# `get_account_balances`

Fetch the historical [`AccountBalance`](../account-balance.md)s of a given [`Account`](../account.md).

**Only accounts created with the [`history`](../account.md#flagshistory) flag set retain historical
balances.** This is off by default.

- Each balance returned has a corresponding transfer with the same
  [`timestamp`](../transfer.md#timestamp). See the
  [`get_account_transfers`](../get_account_transfers.md) operation for more details.

- The amounts refer to the account balance recorded _after_ the transfer execution.

- [Pending](../transfer.md#flagspending) balances automatically removed due to
  [timeout](../transfer.md#timeout) expiration don't change historical balances.

## Event

The account filter.
See [`AccountFilter`](../account-filter.md) for constraints.

## Result

- If the account has the flag [`history`](../account.md#flagshistory) set and any matching
  balances exist, return an array of [`AccountBalance`](../account-balance.md)s.
- If the account does not have the flag [`history`](../account.md#flagshistory) set,
  return nothing.
- If no matching balances exist, return nothing.
- If any constraint is violated, return nothing.
