//! Scrub grid blocks.
//!
//! A "data scrubber" is a background task that gradually/incrementally reads the disk and validates
//! what it finds. Its purpose is to discover faults proactively – as early as possibly – rather
//! than waiting for them to be discovered by normal database operation (e.g. during compaction).
//!
//! The most common type of disk fault is a latent sector error:
//!
//! - A "latent sector error" is the temporary or permanent inability to access the data of a
//!   particular sector. That is, the disk as a whole continues to function, but a small section of
//!   data is unavailable.
//! - "Latent" refers to: the error is not discoverable until the sector is actually read.
//! - "An Analysis of Latent Sector Errors in Disk Drives" (2007) found that >60% of latent sector
//!   errors were discovered by a scrubber that cycles every 2 weeks.
//!
//! Finding and repairing errors proactively minimizes the risk of cluster data loss due to multiple
//! intersecting faults (analogous to a "double-fault") – a scenario where we fail to read a block,
//! and try to repair the block from another replica, only to discover that the copy of the block on
//! the remote replica's disk is *also* faulty.
//!
//! TODO Accelerate scrubbing rate (at runtime) if faults are detected frequently.

// - Faults are independent (i.e. uncorrelated) in space and time. ²

// Pessimistic assumptions:
// - There are only 3 (quorum_replication) copies of each sector.
// - Scrub randomization is ignored.
