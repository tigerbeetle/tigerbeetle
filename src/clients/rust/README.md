# tigerbeetle-rust

The TigerBeetle client for Rust.

[![Rust Reference](todo)](https://docs.rs/tigerbeetle)

## Prerequisites

Linux >= 5.6 is the only production environment we
support. But for ease of development we also support macOS and Windows.
* t o d o

## Setup

First, create a directory for your project and `cd` into the directory.

Then create `Cargo.toml` and copy this into it:

```toml
 t o d o
```

Then, install the TigerBeetle client:

```console
cargo add tigerbeetle
```

Now, create `src/main.rs` and copy this into it:

```rust

fn main() {
// // todo
```

Finally, build and run:

```console
cargo run
```

Now that all prerequisites and dependencies are correctly set
up, let's dig into using TigerBeetle.

## Sample projects

This document is primarily a reference guide to
the client. Below are various sample projects demonstrating
features of TigerBeetle.

* [Basic](/src/clients/rust/samples/basic/): Create two accounts and transfer an amount between them.
* [Two-Phase Transfer](/src/clients/rust/samples/two-phase/): Create two accounts and start a pending transfer between
them, then post the transfer.
* [Many Two-Phase Transfers](/src/clients/rust/samples/two-phase-many/): Create two accounts and start a number of pending transfers
between them, posting and voiding alternating transfers.
## Creating a Client

A client is created with a cluster ID and replica
addresses for all replicas in the cluster. The cluster
ID and replica addresses are both chosen by the system that
starts the TigerBeetle cluster.

Clients are thread-safe and a single instance should be shared
between multiple concurrent tasks. This allows events to be
[automatically batched](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/coding/requests/#batching-events).

Multiple clients are useful when connecting to more than
one TigerBeetle cluster.

In this example the cluster ID is `0` and there is one
replica. The address is read from the `TB_ADDRESS`
environment variable and defaults to port `3000`.

```rust
// // todo
```

The following are valid addresses:
* `3000` (interpreted as `127.0.0.1:3000`)
* `127.0.0.1:3000` (interpreted as `127.0.0.1:3000`)
* `127.0.0.1` (interpreted as `127.0.0.1:3001`, `3001` is the default port)

## Creating Accounts

See details for account fields in the [Accounts
reference](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/account).

```rust
// // todo
```

See details for the recommended ID scheme in
[time-based identifiers](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/coding/data-modeling#tigerbeetle-time-based-identifiers-recommended).

The `Uint128` fields like `ID`, `UserData128`, `Amount` and
account balances have a few helper functions to make it easier
to convert 128-bit little-endian unsigned integers between
`string`, `math/big.Int`, and `[]byte`.

See the type [Uint128](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle-go/pkg/types#Uint128) for more details.

### Account Flags

The account flags value is a bitfield. See details for
these flags in the [Accounts
reference](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/account#flags).

To toggle behavior for an account, use the `types.AccountFlags` struct
to combine enum values and generate a `uint16`. Here are a
few examples:

* `AccountFlags{Linked: true}.ToUint16()`
* `AccountFlags{DebitsMustNotExceedCredits: true}.ToUint16()`
* `AccountFlags{CreditsMustNotExceedDebits: true}.ToUint16()`
* `AccountFlags{History: true}.ToUint16()`

For example, to link two accounts where the first account
additionally has the `debits_must_not_exceed_credits` constraint:

```rust
// // todo
```

### Response and Errors

The response is an array containing the _status code_ and the _timestamp_ of
each account in the request batch:
- Successfully created accounts with the status
  [`created`](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/requests/create_accounts#created)
  return the timestamp assigned to the `Account` object.
- Already existing accounts with the result
  [`exists`](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/requests/create_accounts#exists)
  return the timestamp of the original existing object.
- Failed accounts return the status code along with the timestamp when the validation
  occurred. See all error conditions in the
  [create_accounts reference](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/requests/create_accounts#status).

```rust
// // todo
```

To handle errors you can either 1) exactly match error codes returned
from `client.createAccounts` with enum values in the
`CreateAccountError` object, or you can 2) look up the error code in
the `CreateAccountError` object for a human-readable string.

## Account Lookup

Account lookup is batched, like account creation. Pass
in all IDs to fetch. The account for each matched ID is returned.

If no account matches an ID, no object is returned for
that account. So the order of accounts in the response is
not necessarily the same as the order of IDs in the
request. You can refer to the ID field in the response to
distinguish accounts.

```rust
// // todo
```

## Create Transfers

This creates a journal entry between two accounts.

See details for transfer fields in the [Transfers
reference](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/transfer).

```rust
// // todo
```

See details for the recommended ID scheme in
[time-based identifiers](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/coding/data-modeling#tigerbeetle-time-based-identifiers-recommended).

### Response and Errors

The response is an array containing the _status code_ and the _timestamp_ of
each transfer in the request batch:
- Successfully created transfers with the result
  [`created`](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/requests/create_transfers#created)
  return the timestamp assigned to the `Transfer` object.
- Already existing transfers with the result
  [`exists`](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/requests/create_transfers#exists)
  return the timestamp of the original existing object.
- Failed transfers return the status code along with the timestamp when the validation
  occurred. See all error conditions in the
  [create_transfers reference](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/requests/create_transfers#status).

```rust
// // todo
```

## Batching

TigerBeetle performance is maximized when you batch
API requests.

A client instance shared across multiple threads/tasks can automatically
batch concurrent requests, but the application must still send as many events
as possible in a single call.

For example, if you insert 1 million transfers sequentially, one at a time,
the insert rate will be a *fraction* of the potential, because the client will
wait for a reply between each one.
Instead, **always batch as much as you can**.

The maximum batch size is set in the TigerBeetle server. The default is 8189.

```rust
// // todo
```

### Queues and Workers

If you are making requests to TigerBeetle from workers
pulling jobs from a queue, you can batch requests to
TigerBeetle by having the worker act on multiple jobs from
the queue at once rather than one at a time. i.e. pulling
multiple jobs from the queue rather than just one.

## Transfer Flags

The transfer `flags` value is a bitfield. See details for these flags in
the [Transfers
reference](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/transfer#flags).

To toggle behavior for an account, use the `types.TransferFlags` struct
to combine enum values and generate a `uint16`. Here are a
few examples:

* `TransferFlags{Linked: true}.ToUint16()`
* `TransferFlags{Pending: true}.ToUint16()`
* `TransferFlags{PostPendingTransfer: true}.ToUint16()`
* `TransferFlags{VoidPendingTransfer: true}.ToUint16()`

For example, to link `transfer0` and `transfer1`:

```rust
// // todo
```

### Two-Phase Transfers

Two-phase transfers are supported natively by toggling the appropriate
flag. TigerBeetle will then adjust the `credits_pending` and
`debits_pending` fields of the appropriate accounts. A corresponding
post pending transfer then needs to be sent to post or void the
transfer.

#### Post a Pending Transfer

With `flags` set to `post_pending_transfer`,
TigerBeetle will post the transfer. TigerBeetle will atomically roll
back the changes to `debits_pending` and `credits_pending` of the
appropriate accounts and apply them to the `debits_posted` and
`credits_posted` balances.

```rust
// // todo
```

#### Void a Pending Transfer

In contrast, with `flags` set to `void_pending_transfer`,
TigerBeetle will void the transfer. TigerBeetle will roll
back the changes to `debits_pending` and `credits_pending` of the
appropriate accounts and **not** apply them to the `debits_posted` and
`credits_posted` balances.

```rust
// // todo
```

## Transfer Lookup

NOTE: While transfer lookup exists, it is not a flexible query API. We
are developing query APIs and there will be new methods for querying
transfers in the future.

Transfer lookup is batched, like transfer creation. Pass in all `id`s to
fetch, and matched transfers are returned.

If no transfer matches an `id`, no object is returned for that
transfer. So the order of transfers in the response is not necessarily
the same as the order of `id`s in the request. You can refer to the
`id` field in the response to distinguish transfers.

```rust
// // todo
```

## Get Account Transfers

NOTE: This is a preview API that is subject to breaking changes once we have
a stable querying API.

Fetches the transfers involving a given account, allowing basic filter and pagination
capabilities.

The transfers in the response are sorted by `timestamp` in chronological or
reverse-chronological order.

```rust
// // todo
```

## Get Account Balances

NOTE: This is a preview API that is subject to breaking changes once we have
a stable querying API.

Fetches the point-in-time balances of a given account, allowing basic filter and
pagination capabilities.

Only accounts created with the flag
[`history`](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/account#flagshistory) set retain
[historical balances](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/requests/get_account_balances).

The balances in the response are sorted by `timestamp` in chronological or
reverse-chronological order.

```rust
// // todo
```

## Query Accounts

NOTE: This is a preview API that is subject to breaking changes once we have
a stable querying API.

Query accounts by the intersection of some fields and by timestamp range.

The accounts in the response are sorted by `timestamp` in chronological or
reverse-chronological order.

```rust
// // todo
```

## Query Transfers

NOTE: This is a preview API that is subject to breaking changes once we have
a stable querying API.

Query transfers by the intersection of some fields and by timestamp range.

The transfers in the response are sorted by `timestamp` in chronological or
reverse-chronological order.

```rust
// // todo
```

## Linked Events

When the `linked` flag is specified for an account when creating accounts or
a transfer when creating transfers, it links that event with the next event in the
batch, to create a chain of events, of arbitrary length, which all
succeed or fail together. The tail of a chain is denoted by the first
event without this flag. The last event in a batch may therefore never
have the `linked` flag set as this would leave a chain
open-ended. Multiple chains or individual events may coexist within a
batch to succeed or fail independently.

Events within a chain are executed within order, or are rolled back on
error, so that the effect of each event in the chain is visible to the
next, and so that the chain is either visible or invisible as a unit
to subsequent events after the chain. The event that was the first to
break the chain will have a unique error result. Other events in the
chain will have their error result set to `linked_event_failed`.

```rust
// // todo
```

## Imported Events

When the `imported` flag is specified for an account when creating accounts or
a transfer when creating transfers, it allows importing historical events with
a user-defined timestamp.

The entire batch of events must be set with the flag `imported`.

It's recommended to submit the whole batch as a `linked` chain of events, ensuring that
if any event fails, none of them are committed, preserving the last timestamp unchanged.
This approach gives the application a chance to correct failed imported events, re-submitting
the batch again with the same user-defined timestamps.

```rust
// // todo
```
