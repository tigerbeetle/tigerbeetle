# Transfers

A `transfer` is an immutable record of a financial transaction between
two accounts.

In TigerBeetle, financial transactions are called "transfers" instead of "transactions" because
the latter term is heavily overloaded in the context of databases.

### Updates

Transfers *cannot be modified* after creation.


## Modes

Fields used by each mode of transfer:

| Field                         | Single-Phase | Pending  | Post-Pending | Void-Pending |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| `id`                          | required     | required | required     | required     |
| `debit_account_id`            | required     | required | optional     | optional     |
| `credit_account_id`           | required     | required | optional     | optional     |
| `user_data`                   | optional     | optional | optional     | optional     |
| `reserved`                    | none         | none     | none         | none         |
| `pending_id`                  | none         | none     | required     | required     |
| `timeout`                     | none         | required | none         | none         |
| `ledger`                      | required     | required | optional     | optional     |
| `code`                        | required     | required | optional     | optional     |
| `flags.linked`                | optional     | optional | optional     | optional     |
| `flags.pending`               | false        | true     | false        | false        |
| `flags.post_pending_transfer` | false        | false    | true         | false        |
| `flags.void_pending_transfer` | false        | false    | false        | true         |
| `amount`                      | required     | required | optional     | optional     |

TigerBeetle uses the same data structures internally and
externally. This means that sometimes you need to set temporary values
for fields that TigerBeetle, not you (the user), are responsible.

### Single-Phase Transfer

Single-phase transfers post funds to accounts immediately when they are created.

### Two-Phase Transfer

A pending transfer followed by a post-pending transfer, void-pending transfer, or a timeout is
called a "two-phase transfer". Unlike a single-phase transfer, a two-phase transfer moves funds in
stages:

1. [Reserve funds](#pending-transfer).
2. Resolve funds (post, void, or timeout).

Pending amounts (the pending transfer's [`amount`](#amount)) cannot be spent by either the payer or
payee until the pending transfer is _resolved_ â€” that is, until the first of the following events
occur:

* If a corresponding [`post_pending_transfer`](#post-pending-transfer) is
  committed, some or all of the pending transfer's reserved funds are
  posted, and the remainder (if any) is restored to the original
  accounts.
* If a corresponding [`void_pending_transfer`](#void-pending-transfer) is
  committed, the pending transfer's reserved funds are restored to
  their original accounts.
* If the pending transfer's timeout expires, the pending transfer's
  reserved funds are restored to their original accounts. (When `flags.pending`
  is set, the [`timeout`](#timeout) field must be non-zero.)

A pending transfer resolves at most once.
Attempting to resolve a pending transfer more than once will return the applicable error result:
- [`pending_transfer_already_posted`](./operations/create_transfers.md#pending_transfer_already_posted)
- [`pending_transfer_already_voided`](./operations/create_transfers.md#pending_transfer_already_voided)
- [`pending_transfer_expired`](./operations/create_transfers.md#pending_transfer_expired)

#### Pending Transfer

A pending transfer, denoted by [`flags.pending`](#flagspending),
reserves its `amount` in the debit/credit accounts'
[`debits_pending`](./accounts.md#debits_pending)/[`credits_pending`](./accounts.md#credits_pending)
fields respectively, leaving `debits_posted`/`credits_posted` unmodified.

#### Post-Pending Transfer

A post-pending transfer, denoted by [`flags.post_pending_transfer`](#flagspost_pending_transfer),
causes the corresponding pending transfer (referenced by [`pending_id`](#pending_id)) to "post",
transferring some or all of the pending transfer's reserved amount to its destination, and restoring
(voiding) the remainder (if any) to its origin accounts.

* If the posted `amount` is 0, the full pending transfer's amount is
  posted.
* If the posted `amount` is nonzero, then only this amount is posted,
  and the remainder is restored to its original accounts. It must be
  less than or equal to the pending transfer's amount.

Additionally, when `flags.post_pending_transfer` is set:

* `pending_id` must reference a [pending transfer](#pending-transfer).
* `flags.void_pending_transfer` must not be set.

And the following fields may either be zero, otherwise must match the
value of the pending transfer's field:

* `debit_account_id`
* `credit_account_id`
* `ledger`
* `code`

##### Examples

###### Post Full Pending Amount

| Account `A` |            | Account `B`   |            | Transfers |        |            |                         |
| ----------: | ---------: | ------------: | ---------: | :-------- | :----- | ---------: | :---------------------- |
| **debits**  |            |   **credits** |            |           |        |            |                         |
| **pending** | **posted** |   **pending** | **posted** | **DR**    | **CR** | **amount** | **flags**               |
|         `w` |        `x` |           `y` |        `z` | -         | -      |          - | -                       |

###### Post Partial Pending Amount

| Account `A` |            | Account `B`   |            | Transfers |        |            |                         |

#### Void-Pending Transfer

A void-pending transfer, denoted by [`flags.void_pending_transfer`](#flagsvoid_pending_transfer),
causes the pending transfer (referenced by [`pending_id`](#pending_id)) to void. The pending amount
is restored to its original accounts.

Additionally, when this field is set:

* `pending_id` must reference a [pending transfer](#pending-transfer).
* `flags.post_pending_transfer` must not be set.

And the following fields may either be zero, otherwise must match the
value of the pending transfer's field:

* `debit_account_id`
* `credit_account_id`
* `ledger`
* `code`
* `amount`

###### Example

| Account `A` |            | Account `B`   |            | Transfers |        |            |                         |
| ----------: | ---------: | ------------: | ---------: | :-------- | :----- | ---------: | :---------------------- |
| **debits**  |            |   **credits** |            |           |        |            |                         |
| **pending** | **posted** |   **pending** | **posted** | **DR**    | **CR** | **amount** | **flags**               |
|         `w` |        `x` |           `y` |        `z` | -         | -      |          - | -                       |
|   123 + `w` |        `x` |     123 + `y` |        `z` | `A`       | `B`    |        123 | `pending`               |
|         `w` |        `x` |           `y` |        `z` | `A`       | `B`    |        123 | `void_pending_transfer` |


## Fields

### `id`

This is a unique identifier for the transaction.

As an example, you might generate a [random id](../usage/data-modeling.md#random-identifer) to
identify each transaction.

Constraints:

* Type is 128-bit unsigned integer (16 bytes)
* Must not be zero or `2^128 - 1`
* Must not conflict with another transfer

### `debit_account_id`

This refers to the account to debit the transfer's [`amount`](#amount).

Constraints:

* Type is 128-bit unsigned integer (16 bytes)
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` and `flags.void_pending_transfer` are unset:
  * Must match an existing account
  * Must not be the same as `credit_account_id`
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` or `flags.void_pending_transfer` are set:
  - If `debit_account_id` is zero, it will be automatically set to the pending transfer's
    `debit_account_id`.
  - If `debit_account_id` is nonzero, it must match the corresponding pending transfer's
    `debit_account_id`.

### `credit_account_id`

This refers to the account to credit the transfer's [`amount`](#amount).

Constraints:

* Type is 128-bit unsigned integer (16 bytes)
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` and `flags.void_pending_transfer` are unset:
  * Must match an existing account
  * Must not be the same as `debit_account_id`
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` or `flags.void_pending_transfer` are set:
  - If `credit_account_id` is zero, it will be automatically set to the pending transfer's
    `credit_account_id`.
  - If `credit_account_id` is nonzero, it must match the corresponding pending transfer's
    `credit_account_id`.

### `user_data`

This is an optional secondary identifier to link this transfer to an
external entity.

As an example, you might use a [random id](../usage/data-modeling.md#random-identifer) that ties
together a group of transfers.

For more information, see [Data Modeling](../usage/data-modeling.md#user_data).

Constraints:

* Type is 128-bit unsigned integer (16 bytes)

### `reserved`

This space may be used for additional data in the future.

Constraints:

* Type is 128-bit unsigned integer (16 bytes)
* Must be zero

### `pending_id`

If this transfer will post or void a pending transfer, `pending_id`
references that pending transfer. If this is not a post or void
transfer, it must be zero.

See also:
* [Pending Transfer](#pending-transfer)
* [Post-Pending Transfer](#post-pending-transfer)
* [Void-Pending Transfer](#void-pending-transfer)

Constraints:

* Type is 128-bit unsigned integer (16 bytes)
* Must be zero if neither void nor pending transfer flag is set
* Must match an existing transfer's [`id`](#id) if non-zero

### `timeout`

This is the interval (in nanoseconds) after a
[`pending`](#flagspending) transfer's [arrival at the cluster](#timestamp)
that it may be posted or voided.

If the timeout expires and the pending transfer has not already been
posted or voided, the pending transfer is voided automatically.

Non-pending transfers cannot have a timeout.

Constraints:

* Type is 64-bit unsigned integer (8 bytes)
* Must be zero if `flags.pending` is *not* set
* Must be non-zero if `flags.pending` *is* set
* Must not overflow a 64-bit unsigned integer when summed with the transfer's timestamp
  (`error.overflows_timeout`)

### `ledger`

This is an identifier that partitions the sets of accounts that can
transact with each other. Put another way, money cannot transfer
between two accounts with different `ledger` values. See:
[`accounts_must_have_the_same_ledger`](./operations/create_transfers.md#accounts_must_have_the_same_ledger).

[Currency exchange](../recipes/currency-exchange.md) is implemented with two or more linked
transfers.

Constraints:

* Type is 32-bit unsigned integer (4 bytes)
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` or `flags.void_pending_transfer` is set:
  * If `ledger` is zero, it will be automatically be set to the pending transfer's `ledger`.
  * If `ledger` is nonzero, it must match the `ledger` value on the pending transfer's
    `debit_account_id` **and** `credit_account_id`.
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` and `flags.void_pending_transfer` are not set:
  * `ledger` must not be zero.
  * `ledger` must match the `ledger` value on the accounts referenced in
    `debit_account_id` **and** `credit_account_id`.

### `code`

This is a user-defined enum denoting the reason for (or category of) the
transfer.

Constraints:

* Type is 16-bit unsigned integer (2 bytes)
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` or `flags.void_pending_transfer` is set:
  * If `code` is zero, it will be automatically be set to the pending transfer's `code`.
  * If `code` is nonzero, it must match the pending transfer's `code`.
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` and `flags.void_pending_transfer` are not set, `code` must not
  be zero.

### `flags`

This specifies (optional) transfer behavior.

Constraints:

* Type is 16-bit unsigned integer (2 bytes)

#### `flags.linked`

When the `linked` flag is specified, it links a transfer with the next
transfer in the batch, to create a chain of transfers, of arbitrary
length, which all succeed or fail in creation together. The tail of a
chain is denoted by the first transfer without this flag. The last
transfer in a batch may therefore never have `flags.linked` set as
this would leave a chain open-ended (see `linked_event_chain_open`).

Multiple chains of individual transfers may coexist within a batch to
succeed or fail independently. Transfers within a chain are executed
within order, or are rolled back on error, so that the effect of each
transfer in the chain is visible to the next, and so that the chain is
either visible or invisible as a unit to subsequent transfers after the
chain. The transfer that was the first to break the chain will have a
unique error result. Other transfers in the chain will have their error
result set to
[`linked_event_failed`](./operations/create_transfers.md#linked_event_failed).

Consider this set of transfers as part of a batch:

| Transfer | Index within batch | flags.linked |
|----------|--------------------|--------------|
| `A`      | `0`                | `false`      |
| `B`      | `1`                | `true`       |
| `C`      | `2`                | `true`       |
| `D`      | `3`                | `false`      |
| `E`      | `4`                | `false`      |

If any of transfers `B`, `C`, or `D` fail (for example, due to
[`exceeds_credits`](./operations/create_transfers.md#exceeds_credits),
then `B`, `C`, and `D` will all fail. They are linked.

Transfers `A` and `E` fail or succeed independently of `B`, `C`, `D`,
and each other.

After the link has executed, the association of each event is lost.
To save the association, it must be
[encoded into the data model](../usage/data-modeling.md).

##### Examples

- [Currency Exchange](../recipes/currency-exchange.md)

#### `flags.pending`

Mark the transfer as a [pending transfer](#pending-transfer).

#### `flags.post_pending_transfer`

Mark the transfer as a [post-pending transfer](#post-pending-transfer).

#### `flags.void_pending_transfer`

Mark the transfer as a [void-pending transfer](#void-pending-transfer).

### `amount`

This is how much should be debited from the `debit_account_id` account
and credited to the `credit_account_id` account.

Constraints:

* Type is 64-bit unsigned integer (8 bytes)
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` is set:
  * If `amount` is zero, it will be automatically be set to the pending transfer's `amount`.
  * If `amount` is nonzero, it must be less than or equal to the pending transfer's `amount`.
* When `flags.void_pending_transfer` is set:
  * If `amount` is zero, it will be automatically be set to the pending transfer's `amount`.
  * If `amount` is nonzero, it must be equal to the pending transfer's `amount`.
* When `flags.post_pending_transfer` and `flags.void_pending_transfer` are not set, `amount` must
  not be zero.

#### Examples

- For representing fractional amounts (e.g. `$12.34`), see
  [Fractional Amounts](../recipes/fractional-amounts.md).

### `timestamp`

This is the time the transfer was created, as nanoseconds since
UNIX epoch.

It is set by TigerBeetle to the moment the transfer arrives at
the cluster.

Additionally, all timestamps are unique, immutable and [totally
ordered](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/time.html). So a transfer that
is created before another transfer is guaranteed to have an earlier
timestamp. In other systems this is also called a "physical"
timestamp, "ingestion" timestamp, "record" timestamp, or "system"
timestamp.

Constraints:

* Type is 64-bit unsigned integer (8 bytes)
* User sets to zero on creation
