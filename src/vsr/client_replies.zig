//! Store the latest reply to every active client session.
//!
//! This allows them to be resent to the corresponding client if the client missed the original
//! reply message (e.g. dropped packet).
//!
//! - Client replies' headers are stored in the `client_sessions` trailer.
//! - Client replies (header and body) are only stored by ClientReplies in the `client_replies` zone
//!   when `reply.header.size ≠ sizeOf(Header)` – that is, when the body is non-empty.
//! - Corrupt client replies can be repaired from other replicas.
//!
//! Replies are written asynchronously. Subsequent writes for the same client may be coalesced –
//! we only care about the last reply to each client session.
//!
//! ClientReplies guarantees that the latest replies are durable at checkpoint.
//!
//! If the same reply is corrupted by all replicas, the cluster is still available.
//! If the respective client also never received the reply (due to a network fault), the client may
//! be "locked out" of the cluster – continually retrying a request which has been executed, but
//! whose reply has been permanently lost. This can be resolved by the operator restarting the
//! client to create a new session.
