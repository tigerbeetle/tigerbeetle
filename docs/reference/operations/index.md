# Operations

An _operation_ queries or updates the database state.

There are four operations available to clients:

- [`create_accounts`](./create_accounts.md): create `Account`s
- [`create_transfers`](./create_transfers.md): create `Transfer`s
- [`lookup_accounts`](./lookup_accounts.md): fetch `Account`s by `id`
- [`lookup_transfers`](./lookup_transfers.md): fetch `Transfer`s by `id`

## Events and Results

Each operation has a corresponding _event_ and _result_ type.

- The client sends events to the cluster.
- The client receives results from the cluster (1:1 for each event sent).
- Events and results for the same operation are
  [batched](../../usage/integration.md#batching-events) for throughput.
- A batch of an operation's events is called a [_request_](../../usage/integration.md#requests).
- A batch of an operation's results is called a _reply_.

Client implementations provide an API for sending batched events and decoding the corresponding
batched results.
