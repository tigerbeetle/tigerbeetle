# Two-Phase Transfer Node.js Sample

Code for this sample is in [./main.js](./main.js).

## Prerequisites

Linux >= 5.6 is the only production environment we
support. But for ease of development we also support macOS and Windows.
* NodeJS >= `14`

## Setup

First, clone this repo and `cd` into `tigerbeetle/src/clients/node/samples/two-phase`.

Then, install the TigerBeetle client:

```console
npm install tigerbeetle-node
```

## Start the TigerBeetle server

Follow steps in the repo README to [run
TigerBeetle](/README.md#running-tigerbeetle).

If you are not running on port `localhost:3000`, set
the environment variable `TB_ADDRESS` to the full
address of the TigerBeetle server you started.

## Run this sample

Now you can run this sample:

```console
node main.js
```

## Walkthrough

Here's what this project does.

## 1. Create accounts

This project starts by creating two accounts (`1` and `2`).

## 2. Create pending transfer

Then it begins a
pending transfer of `500` of an amount from account `1` to
account `2`.

## 3. Fetch and validate pending account balances

Then it fetches both accounts and validates that **account `1`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 0`
 * `credits_posted = 0`
 * `debits_pending = 500`
 * and `credits_pending = 0`

And that **account `2`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 0`
 * `credits_posted = 0`
 * `debits_pending = 0`
 * and `credits_pending = 500`

(This is because a pending
transfer only affects **pending** credits and debits on accounts,
not **posted** credits and debits.)

## 4. Post pending transfer

Then it creates a second transfer that marks the first
transfer as posted.

## 5. Fetch and validate transfers

Then it fetches both transfers, validates
that the two transfers exist, validates that the first
transfer had (and still has) a `pending` flag, and validates
that the second transfer had (and still has) a
`post_pending_transfer` flag.

## 6. Fetch and validate final account balances

Finally, it fetches both accounts, validates they both exist,
and checks that credits and debits for both account are now
*posted*, not pending.

Specifically, that **account `1`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 500`
 * `credits_posted = 0`
 * `debits_pending = 0`
 * and `credits_pending = 0`

And that **account `2`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 0`
 * `credits_posted = 500`
 * `debits_pending = 0`
 * and `credits_pending = 0`
