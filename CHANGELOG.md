## TigerBeetle 0.16.51

Released: 2025-07-18


### Safety And Performance

- [#3096](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/3096)

  Fix incorrect assert in the commit stall logic.

  This assert could cause the primary to crash while it is injecting a commit stall, if an old
  primary has committed ahead of it.

- [#3008](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/3008)

  Improve compaction scheduling algorithm to be more performant and memory efficient.

  Earlier, during each beat, we used to compact each active tree and level, leading to multiple
  context switches. Now, we compact each tree and level to completion before moving on to the next.

## TigerBeetle 0.16.43

Released: 2025-05-30

This release includes the `tigerbeetle recover` subcommand, which can be used to _safely_ recover a
replica that is permanantly lost.

Additionally, it includes Change Data Capture (CDC) support to stream TigerBeetle state to Advanced
Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) targets, such as RabbitMQ and other compatible brokers.

Check out the [documentation](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/operating/) to learn about how to use
CDC and `tigerbeetle recover`!


### Safety And Performance

- [#2996](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2996)

  Add the `tigerbeetle recover` subcommand, to safely recover a replica that is permanantly lost
  (e.g. if the SSD fails).

  Earlier, the only way to recover a permanantly lost replica was using the `tigerbeetle format`
  command. Howerver, this was unsafe, as a newly-formatted replica may nack prepares which its
  previous incarnation acked -- a correctness bug.

- [#2880](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2880)

  Implement an adaptive replication routing protocol to handle changes in network topology.

  To select the best route, primary uses outcome-focused explore-exploit approach. Every once in a
  while, the primary tries an alternative route, and replaces the current route if the alternative
  provides better replication latency.

- [#2970](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2970),
  [#3002](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/3002)

  Replica pulls messages from the MessageBus, as opposed to the MessageBus pushing messages.

  Earlier, replicas had to process _every_ message that the bus pushed. This could lead to messages
  being dropped due to lack of available disk read/write IOPs. Now, a replica can "suspend" certain
  messages and return to them later when it has enough IOPs.

### Features

- [#2917](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2917)

  CDC support to stream TigerBeetle state to AMQP targets, such as RabbitMQ and other compatible
  brokers.

  We implement the AMQP 0.9.1 specification instead of AMQP 1.0 as it is simpler and more widely
  supported (e.g., RabbitMQ only recently added native AMQP 1.0 support).

### Internals

- [#2982](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2982)

  Unify the production and testing AOF code paths to make sure the production AOF is rigorously
  fuzzed by the VOPR.

- [#2991](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2991)

  Reduce code duplication while erasing IO callbacks' type.

- [#2998](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2998)

  Track debug build times on DevHub.

- [#2987](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2987),

  Fix AOF `unflushed` assertion.

- [#2950](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2950)

  Decouple prepare repair from header breaks. This helps a replica repair faster, and prevents a
  case where we would request a prepare only to discard it when it arrives.

- [#2945](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2945),
  [#2961](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2961)

  Bump default journal write iops. Previously we were inadvertently throttling repair by not
  allocating enough.

- [#2944](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2944)

  Primary now broadcasts `start_view` message on checkpoint durability.
  This will help syncing replicas update to the latest sync target as early as possible.

## TigerBeetle 0.16.39

Released: 2025-05-02

Heads up, we are changing our release process! From this point on, a TigerBeetle release is tagged
on Friday, spends a weekend on the
[CFO fleet](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/src/scripts/cfo.zig), and is
published on Monday. In other words, you'll still be getting a new release every Monday, but the
date of the release will be set to Friday. This setup allows extra time for fuzzers to find problems
in the specific commit we are trying to release.

## TigerBeetle 0.16.35

Released: 2025-04-07

Please note that after [#2787](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2787), which adds
batching support for all operations, the `batch_max` limit has changed from 8190 to 8189
accounts/transfers per batch.

### Safety And Performance

- [#2787](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2787)

  Add support for batching multiple independent requests of the same operation within a single VSR
  message, amortizing network and consensus costs.

  Earlier, we batched only create_accounts and create_transfers. Now, we can batch any operation!

### Internals

- [#2798](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2798),
  [#2815](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2815)

  Vendor the PRNG, and tweak the API to be less wordy.

  PRNG algorithms tend to change, often for reasons not applicable to TigerBeetle. We need neither
  the fastest, nor the most secure PRNG, and it's better if we rotate our PRNG algorithm at our own
  pace.

- [#2813](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2813)

## TigerBeetle 0.16.30

Released: 2025-03-03

Note: Before performing this upgrade, please make sure to check that no replicas are lagging and
state syncing.

You can ensure this by temporarily pausing load to the TigerBeetle cluster and waiting for all
replicas to catch up. If some replicas in your cluster were indeed lagging, you should see
`on_repair_sync_timeout: request sync; lagging behind cluster` in the logs, followed by
`sync: ops=`, which indicates the end of state sync. If you don't see the former in the logs, then
you are already safe to upgrade!

This is to work around an issue in the upgrade between 0.16.25 → 0.16.26, wherein a state syncing
replica goes into a crash loop when it upgrades to 0.16.26. If one of your replicas has already hit
this crash loop, please reach out to us on the Community Slack so we can help you safely revive it.

### Safety And Performance

- [#2681](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2681)

  Consider blocks and prepares with nonzero padding to be corrupt.
  Previously blocks asserted zero padding, which can fail due to bitrot.

  Also fix a similar bug in the superblock copy index handling. The copy index is not covered
  by a checksum, so we must treat it carefully to avoid propagating bad data if it is corrupt.

  VOPR now injects single-bit errors into storage rather than whole-sector errors.

- [#2600](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2600)

  The current checkpoint process immediately frees all blocks released in the previous checkpoint.
  This can lead to cluster unavailability by prematurely freeing and overwriting released blocks.

  To fix this, delay freeing blocks until the checkpoint is durable on a commit-quorum, ensuring
  data integrity and preventing single-replica failures (in a 3 node cluster) from impacting
  availability.

- [#2692](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2692)

  When state syncing, replicas would send prepare_oks only up to a point, to ensure they don't
  falsely contribute to the durability of a non-durable checkpoint they've synced to.

  However, the logic to send these prepare_oks after state sync has finished was missing, which
  could lead to a situation where a primary was unavailable to advance. Add in the ability to send
  these prepare_oks after syncing.

- [#2689](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2689)

  Recently, tb_client was reworked to use OS native signals instead of a socket for delivering
  cross thread events.

- [#2662](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2662)

  TigerBeetle recently gained the ability to do runtime debug logging with `--log-debug`. Extend
  that to other subcommands - not just `start`.

  Additionally, the Python client now has logs integrated with Python's native `logging` module,
  which means no more printing to stderr!

### Safety And Performance

- [#2584](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2584)

  Our repair can create a feedback loop. Repair requests prepares and headers, but, upon receiving
  back, we re-trigger repair, which could lead to duplicate repair work.

  To avoid that, make sure that we are not sending more than two repair messages per replica per our
  repair timeout.

- [You Bring Out The Boogie In Me](https://youtu.be/0AsLHBAbByk)

## TigerBeetle 0.16.17

Released: 2024-12-09

This release includes a correctness fix for the preview API `get_account_balances`,
`get_account_transfers`, `query_accounts`, and `query_transfers`. If your application uses these
features it might be affected.

### Safety And Performance

- [#2544](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2544)

  Fix correctness bug which affected the preview `get_account_balances`, `get_account_transfers`,
  `query_accounts`, and `query_transfers` queries. Specifically, if several filters are used (that
  is, several fields in `QueryFilter` or `AccountFilter` are set), then some objects might be
  missing from the result set.

  The underlying data is safely stored in the database, so re-running these queries using the new
  version of TigerBeetle will give correct results.

- [#2550](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2550)

  Fix panic in the node client which occurred on eviction.

- [#2534](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2534)

  Fix incorrect ABI used on aarch64 for the client library. To prevent such issues from cropping up
  in the future, add aarch64 testing to CI.

- [#2520](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2520)

  Add extra assertions to verify object cache consistency.

- [#2485](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2485)

  Implement network fault injection in Vörtex, our non-deterministic whole system simulator.

### Features

- [#2539](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2539)

  Log level can now be specified at runtime.

- [#2538](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2538)

### Internals

- [#2543](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2543)

  Relax compiler requirements for building TigerBeetle. While we only support building using one
  specific version of Zig, the one downloaded via `./zig/download.sh`, you can try using other
  versions.

- [#2533](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2533)

  Document how to handle errors during release. TigerBeetle's release process is complicated, as we
  need to release, in lockstep, both the `tigerbeetle` binary and all the related client libraries.
  The release process is intentionally designed to be "highly-available", such that a failure of any
  aspect of a release can be safely detected, isolated, and repaired. But, so far, this wasn't
  clearly spelled out in the documentation!

  Require that all replicas in a cluster have the latest TigerBeetle binary as a precondition for an
  upgrade.

- [#2506](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2506)

  Fix several bugs when handling misdirected writes. That is, situations when the disk reports
  a write as successful, despite the write ending up in the wrong place on the disk!

- [#2478](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2478)

  Make sure that TigerBeetle memory is not swappable, otherwise a storage fault can occur in a
  currently swapped-out page, circumventing TigerBeetle guarantees.

- [#2522](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2522)

  REPL correctly emits errors when several objects are used as an argument of an operation that

### Internals

- [#2526](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2526)

  Ignore OOM failures during fuzzing. Fuzzers normally don't use that much memory, but, depending on
  random parameters selected by swarm testing, there are big outliers. If all concurrent fuzzers hit
  a seed that requires a lot of memory, a fuzzing machine runs out of physical RAM. Handle such
  errors and don't treat them as fuzzing failures.

- [#2510](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2510)

Released: 2024-11-25

### Safety And Performance

- [#2501](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2501)

  Call `DetachCurrentThread` when the Java client is closed. The underlying Zig TigerBeetle client
  runs in a separate thread internally, and a handler to this thread was being leaked.

  This is not noticeable in normal operation, but could impact long running processes that
  create and close clients frequently.

- [#2492](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2492)

  Document that it's not possible to currently look up or query more than a full batch of accounts
  atomically without using the history flag and querying balances.

- [#2434](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2434)

  Add the ability to check timestamp order - and verify they are monotonically increasing - for
  accounts and transfers inside Vortex.

### Internals

- [#2455](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2455)

  Recently the VOPR has gotten too good, and it's very tempting to switch to an empirical mode of
  coding: write some code and let the VOPR figure out whether it is correct or not.

  This is suboptimal - silence of the VOPR doesn't guarantee total absence of bugs and safety comes
  in layers and cross checks. Just formal or informal reasoning is not enough, we need both.

  Document this in TigerStyle.

- [#2472](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2472)

  Previously, the Zig part of languages clients logged directly to stderr using Zig's `std.log`, but
  since directly outputting to stderr is considered rude for a library, logging was disabled.

  This PR adds in scaffolding for sending these logs to the client language to be handled there,
  tying in with native log libraries (e.g., Log4j). No languages use it yet, however.

  Additionally, log `warn` and `err` directly to stderr, if there's no handler.

- [#2461](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2461)

  Fix a broken assert when a recently-state-synced replica that has not completed journal repair
  receives an old `commit` message.

- [#2474](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2474)

  Retry `EAGAIN` on (disk) reads. This is essential for running TigerBeetle on XFS, since XFS
  returns `EAGAIN` unexpectedly.

- [#2476](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2476)

  Fix a message bus crash when a client reconnects to a replica without the replica receiving a
  disconnect for the first connection.

- [#2475](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2475)

  Save 256KiB of RAM by not having a prefetch cache for historical balances.
  (Historical balances are never prefetched, so this cache was unused.)

- [#2482](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2482)

  Update hardware requirements in the documentation to include the recommended network bandwidth,
  advice for very large data files, and farther emphasis on the importance of ECC RAM.

- [#2484](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2484)

  Don't panic the client when the client's session is
  [evicted](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/sessions/#eviction).
  Instead, report an error any time a new batch is submitted to the evicted client.
  (How the error is reported depends on the client language – e.g. Java throws an exception, whereas
  Node.js rejects the `Promise`).

  Note that if running clients are evicted, that typically indicates that there are too many clients
  running – check out the
  [suggested system architecture](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/coding/system-architecture/).

### Features

- [#2435](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2435)

  Fix an attempt to access uninitialized fields of `tb_packet_t` when `tb_client_deinit` aborts
  pending requests. Also add Java unit tests to reproduce the problem and validate the fix.

- [#2437](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2437)

  Fix a liveness issue where the cluster gets stuck despite sufficient durability, caused by buggy
  logic for cycling through faulty blocks during repair. Now, we divide the request buffer between
  the `read_global_queue` and `faulty_blocks`, ensuring that we always request blocks from both.

### Features

  Update DevHub styling.

- [#2424](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2424)

### Safety And Performance

- [#2356](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2356)

  Add "Vortex" – a full-system integration test.
  Notably, unlike the VOPR this test suite covers the language clients.

- [#2430](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2430)

  Cancel in-flight async (Linux) IO before freeing memory. This was not an issue on the replica
  side, as replicas only stop when their process stops. However, clients may be closed
  without the process also ending. If IO is still in flight when this occurs, we must ensure that
  all IO is cancelled before the client's buffers are freed, to guard against a use-after-free.

  This PR also fixes an unrelated assertion failure that triggered when closing a client that
  had already closed its socket.

- [#2432](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2432)

  On startup and after checkpoint, assert that number of blocks acquired by the free set is
  consistent with the number of blocks we see acquired via the manifest and checkpoint trailers.

- [#2436](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2436)

  Reject connections from unknown replicas.

### Safety And Performance

- [#2428](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2428)

  Make `Grid.reserve()` abort rather than returning null.
  When `Grid.reserve()` aborts, that indicates that the data file size limit would be exceeded by
  the reservation. We were already panicking in this case by unwrapping the result, but now it has
  a useful error message.

- [#2416](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2416)

  Improve availability and performance by sending `start_view` message earlier in the new-primary
  recovery – as soon as the journal headers are repaired.

- [#2360](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2360)

  Refactor compaction to clarify the scheduling logic, schedule more aggressively, and make it

### Features

- [#2425](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2425)

  Add a unit test for Zig's stdlib sort.

  Stable sort is critical for compaction correctness. Zig stdlib does have a sort fuzz test, but it
  doesn't cover the presorted subarray case, and doesn't check arrays much larger than the sort
  algorithm's on-stack cache.

- [#2413](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2413)

## TigerBeetle 0.16.9

Released: 2024-10-15

### Safety And Performance

- [#2394](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2394),
  [#2401](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2401)

  TigerBeetle clients internally batch operations for improved performance. Fix a bug where an
  unclosed link chain could be batched before another linked chain, causing them to be treated as
  one long linked chain. Additionally, prevent non-batchable requests from sharing packets entirely.

- [#2398](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2398)

  `AMOUNT_MAX` is used as a sentinel value for things like balancing transfers to specify moving
  as much as possible. Correct and fix its value in the Java client. Thanks @tKe!

### Features

- [#2274](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2274)

  Improve the benchmark by adding Zipfian distributed random numbers, to better simulate realistic
  conditions and as a precursor to approximating YCSB.

- [#2393](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2393)

  Previously, TigerBeetle's clients disallowed empty batches locally, before the request was even
  sent to the cluster. However, this is actually a valid protocol message - even if it's not used by
  the current state machine - so allow empty batches to be sent from clients.

- [#2384](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2384)

  Revamp client documentation so that each snippet is self-contained, and standardize it across all
  languages.

### Internals

- [#2404](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2404)

## TigerBeetle 0.16.8

Released: 2024-10-07

### Safety And Performance

- [#2359](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2359)

  Significantly reduced P100 latency by incrementally spreading the mutable table's sort during
  compaction. This leverages the optimization of sort algorithms for processing sequences of
  already sorted sub-arrays.

- [#2367](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2367)

  Improve the workload generator to support concurrent tests with different ledgers.

- [#2382](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2382),
  [#2363](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2363)

  For more awesome details about the backstory and solutions to these issues,
  please refer to the PR.

### Features

- [#2358](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2358)

  Update the REPL to support representing the maximum integer value as `-0`,
  serving as the `AMOUNT_MAX` sentinel.
  Additionally, other negative values such as `-1` can be used to represent `maxInt - 1`.

  Also, include support for hexadecimal numbers for more convenient inputting of GUID/UUID
  literals (e.g. `0xa1a2a3a4_b1b2_c1c2_d1d2_e1e2e3e4e5e6`).

  Allow the `timestamp` field to be set, enabling the REPL to be used for `imported` events.

### Internals

- [#2376](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2376)

  Use `zig fetch` as a replacement for downloading files, removing dependence on external tools.

- [#2383](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2383)

  Port of Rust's [`dbg!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.dbg.html) macro to Zig,
  and the corresponding CI validation to prevent code using it from being merged into `main`! 😎

- [#2370](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2370),
  [#2373](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2373)

  Verify the release versions included in the multiversion binary pack at build time (not only
  during runtime) and improve the `tigerbeetle version --verbose` command's `multiversion` output.

- [#2369](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2369)

  Fix a multiversioning issue where the binary size exceeded the read buffer, failing to parse the
  executable header.

- [#2380](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2380)

  Consistently use `transient_error` instead of `transient_failure` and cleanup the StateMachine
  code.

- [#2379](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2379)

  Add missing links to the operations `query_accounts` and `query_transfers` in the documentation
  and include the declaration for `QueryFilter` and `QueryFilterFlags` in the `tb_client.h` header.

- [#2333](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2333)

  Clearer error message when the replica crashes due to a data file being too large, instructing
  the operator to increase the memory allocated for the manifest log.

## TigerBeetle 0.16.7

Released: 2024-10-04

Note: this is an extra release to correct an availability issue in the upgrade path for `0.16.4`.
Specifically, the combination of `tigerbeetle 0.16.4` and a client at `0.16.3` can lead to an
assertion failure and a server crash. No data is lost, but the server becomes unavailable.

It is recommended to upgrade to `0.16.7`, but this is only _required_ if you are running older
clients. To upgrade, replace the binary on disk, and manually restart the replica.

Note that although the release is tagged at `0.16.7`, the binary advertises itself as `0.16.4`.

### Safety And Performance

- [#2377](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2378)

  Fix an assertion which was incorrect when a pre-transient-error client retried a transient error,
  and that transient error condition since disappeared. This mirrors #2345 which handles the case
  when it is still failing.

## TigerBeetle 0.16.6

Released: 2024-10-04

Note: this is an extra release to correct a potential issue in the upgrade path for `0.16.4`.
Specifically, the combination of `tigerbeetle 0.16.2` and newer, and any client before `0.16.2` can
lead to an assertion failure and a server crash. No data is lost, but the server becomes
unavailable.

It is recommended to upgrade to `0.16.6`, but this is only _required_ if you are running older
clients. To upgrade, replace the binary on disk, and manually restart the replica.

Note that although the release is tagged at `0.16.6`, the binary advertises itself as `0.16.4`.

### Safety And Performance

- [#2377](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2377)

  Correctly parse AccountFilter from pre `0.16.2` clients.

## TigerBeetle 0.16.5

Released: 2024-10-03

Note: this is an extra release to correct an availability issue in the upgrade path for `0.16.4`.
Specifically, the combination of `tigerbeetle 0.16.4` and a client at `0.16.3` can lead to an
assertion failure and a server crash. No data is lost, but the server becomes unavailable.

It is recommended to upgrade to `0.16.5`, but this is only _required_ if you are running older

  Fix an assertion which was incorrect when a pre-transient-error client retried a transient error.

## TigerBeetle 0.16.4

Released: 2024-09-30

This release introduces "transient errors": error codes for `create_transfers` which depend on the
state of the database (e.g. `exceeds_credits`). Going forward, a transfer that fails with a
transient error will not succeed if retried.

See the [API tracking issue](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/issues/2231#issuecomment-2377879726)
and the [documentation](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/requests/create_transfers)
for more details.

### Safety And Performance

- [#2345](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2345)

  Reduce chance of `recovering_head` status by recovering from torn writes in the WAL.
  This improves the availability of the cluster, as `recovering_head` replicas cannot participate in
  consensus until after they repair.

### Features

- [#2335](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2335)

  Ensure idempotence for `create_transfers`' "transient errors" with new result code
  `id_already_failed`. In particular, this guards against surprising behavior when the client is
  running in a [stateless API service](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/coding/system-architecture/).

## TigerBeetle 0.16.0

Released: 2024-09-02

This release is 0.16.0 as it includes a new breaking API change around zero amount transfers, as
well as the behavior around posting a full pending transfer amount or balancing as much as possible.
These are all gated by the client's release version.

If you're running a client older than 0.16.0, you'll see the old behavior where zero amount
transfers are disallowed, but on newer clients these are supported and will create a transfer with
an amount of 0.

Additionally, the sentinel value to representing posting the full amount of a pending transfer, or
doing a balancing transfer for as much as possible has changed. It's no longer 0, but instead
`AMOUNT_MAX`.

See the [**tracking issue**](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/issues/2231#issuecomment-2305132591) for more details.

### Safety And Performance

- [#2221](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2221)

  Change how replicas that haven't finished syncing send a `prepare_ok` message,
  preventing them from falsely contributing to the durability of a checkpoint, which could
  potentially cause liveness issues in the event of storage faults.

- [#2255](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2255)

  The new state sync protocol regressed the behavior where the replica would try to repair the WAL
  before switching to state sync, and this puts the old behavior back in.

  [WAL repair](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/about/internals/vsr#protocol-repair-wal) is used when
  the lagging replica's log still intersects with the cluster's current log, while
  [state sync](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/about/internals/sync) is used when the logs no
  longer intersect.

- [#2244](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2244)

  Try to repair (but not commit) prepares, even if we don't have all the headers between checkpoint
  and head.

  This makes things consistent between the normal and repair paths, and improves concurrency while
  repairing.

- [#2253](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2253)

  Reject prepares on the primary if its view isn't durable, much like solo clusters.

  This solves a failing VOPR seed wherein a primary accepting prepares before making its log_view
  durable exposes a break in its hash chain.

- [#2259](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2259),
  [#2246](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2246)

  A few `sysctl`s and security frameworks (e.g., seccomp) might block io_uring. Print out a more
  helpful error message, rather than a generic "permission denied" or "system outdated".


### Features

- [#2171](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2171)

  Add the new `imported` flag to allow user-defined timestamps when creating
  `Account`s and `Transfer`s from historical events.

- [#2220](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2220),
  [#2237](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2237),
  [#2238](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2238),
  [#2239](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2239)

  Allow `Transfer`s with `amount=0` and change behavior for _balancing_ and _post-pending_
  transfers, introducing the constant `AMOUNT_MAX` to replace the use of the zero sentinel when
  representing the maximum/original value in such cases.  Note that this is a
  [**breaking change**](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/issues/2231#issuecomment-2305132591).

  Also, explicitly define _optional indexes_, which previously were determined simply by not
  indexing zeroed values.

- [#2234](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2234)

  Introduce a new flag, `Account.flags.closed`, which causes an account to reject any further
  transfers, except for voiding two-phase transfers that are still pending.

  The account flag can be set during creation or through a closing transfer. In the latter case,
  closed account can be re-opened by voiding or expiring the closing transfer.


### Internals

- [#2211](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2211)

  Deprecates the old state sync protocol, no longer supporting both protocols simultaneously.
  As planned for this release, it only ignores old messages, allowing replicas to upgrade normally.
  In the next release, replicas would panic if they receive an old message.

- [#2233](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2233)

  Move multiversion build logic into `build.zig` from `release.zig`. This makes it much easier to
  build multiversion binaries as part of a regular `zig build`, without having to invoke CI or
  release process specific code that's normally part of `release.zig`.

  It also makes it possible to build multiversion binaries on platforms that aren't x86_64 Linux.

- [#2215](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2215)

  Refactor the _Multiversion_ API, bringing it in line with pre-existing code patterns.

- [#2251](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2251)

  Previously, TigerBeetle release numbers were based on a finicky conversion of GitHub's internal
  action run number to a version number.

  This was error prone, and difficult to reason about before hand (what would the given version
  number for a release be?). Instead, make it so this very changelog is the source of truth for
  the version number which is explicitly set.

- [#2252](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2252)

  Change `init` function signatures to allow for in-place initialization. This addresses the silent
  stack growth caused by intermediate copy/move allocations during the initialization of large
  objects.

  Specifically, the `Forest` struct can grow indefinitely depending on the number of
  `Grooves`/`IndexTrees` needed to support the StateMachine's custom logic, causing TigerBeetle to
  crash during startup due to stack-overflow.

- [#2265](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2265)

  Don't cancel in-progress GitHub actions on the main branch. In particular, this ensures that the

- [#2218](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2218)

  Make the experimental feature `aof` (append-only file) a runtime flag instead of a build-time
  setting. This simplifies operations, allowing the use of the same standard release binary in
  environments that require `aof`.

- [#2228](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2228)

  Renames the LSM constant `lsm_batch_multiple` to `lsm_compaction_ops`, providing clearer meaning

## TigerBeetle 0.15.5

Released: 2024-08-12

Highlight of this release is fully rolled-out support for multiversion binaries. This means that,
from now on, the upgrade procedure is going to be as simple as dropping the new version of
`tigerbeetle` binary onto the servers. TigerBeetle will take care of restarting the cluster at the
new version when it is appropriate. See <https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/operating/upgrading> for
reference documentation.

Note that the upgrade procedure from `0.15.3` and `0.15.4` is a bit more involved.

- When upgrading from `0.15.3`, you'll need to stop and restart `tigerbeetle` binary manually.
- When upgrading from `0.15.4`, the binary will stop automatically by hitting an `assert`. You
  should restart it after that.

### Safety And Performance

- [#2174](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2174)
  [#2190](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2190),

  [#2196](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2196)

  Make the root directory smaller by getting rid of `scripts` and `.gitattributes` entries.
  Root directory is the first thing you see when opening the repository, this space shouldn't be
  wasted!

### Safety And Performance

- [#2140](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2140),
  [#2154](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2154)

  Fix a bug where MessageBus sees block/reply messages (due to state sync or repair) and peer_type
  says they are always from replica 0 (since Header.Block.replica == 0 always). So, if they are
  being sent by a non-R0 replica, it drops the messages with "message from unexpected peer".

  This leads to a replica being stuck in state sync and unable to progress.

- [#2137](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2137)

  It was possible for a prepare to exist in a mixture of WALs and checkpoints, which could
  compromise physical durability under storage fault conditions, since the data is present across a
  commit-quorum of replicas in different forms.

  Rather, ensure a prepare in the WAL is only overwritten if it belongs to a commit-quorum of
  checkpoints.

- [#2127](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2127),
  [#2096](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2096)

  A few CI changes: run tests in CI for x86_64 macOS, add in client tests on macOS and run the
  benchmark with `--validate` in CI.

- [#2117](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2117)

  TigerBeetle reserves the most significant bit of the timestamp as the tombstone flag, so indicate
  and assert that timestamp_max is a `maxInt(u63)`.

- [#2123](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2123),
  [#2125](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2125)

  Internally, TigerBeetle uses AEGIS-128L for checksumming - hardware AES is a prerequisite for
  performance. Due to a build system bug, releases being built with a specified (`-Dtarget=`) target
  would only be built with baseline CPU features, and thus use the software AES implementation.

  Enforce at comptime that hardware acceleration is available, fix the build system bug, log
  checksum performance on our [devhub](https://tigerbeetle.github.io/tigerbeetle/) and build client
  libraries with hardware acceleration too.

- [#2139](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2139)

  TigerBeetle would wait until all repairable headers are fixed before trying to commits prepares,
  but if all the headers after the checkpoint are present then we can start committing even if
  some headers from before the checkpoint are missing.

- [#2141](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2141)

  Clarify that the order of replicas in `--addresses` is important. Currently, the order of replicas
  as specified has a direct impact on how messages are routed between them. Having a differing order
  leads to significantly degraded performance.

- [#2120](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2120)

  The state machine depended on `prepare_timestamp` to evaluate `pulse()`, but in an idle cluster,
  `prepare_timestamp` would only be set if pulse returned true! Thanks @ikolomiets for reporting.

- [#2028](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2028)

  Add a fuzzer for scans.

- [#2109](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2109)

  Fuzz `storage.zig`, by using a mocked IO layer.

### Features

- [#2070](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2070)

  Certain workloads (for example, sending in tiny batches) can cause high amounts of space
  amplification in TigerBeetle, leading to data file sizes that are much larger than optimal.

  This introduces a stopgap fix, greedily coalescing tables in level 0 of the LSM, which improves
  space amplification dramatically.

- [#2003](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2003)

  Add a data file inspector tool to the TigerBeetle CLI, handy for development and debugging alike.
  You can run it with `tigerbeetle inspect --help`.

- [#2136](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2136),
  [#2013](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2013),
  [#2126](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2126)

  TigerBeetle clusters can now be [upgraded](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/operating/upgrading)!

- [#2095](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2095)

  Add a custom formatter for displaying units in error messages. Thanks @tensorush!

### Internals

- [#1380](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1380)

  Allows for language clients to manage their own `Packet` memory, removing the need for tb_client
  to do so and thus removing the concepts of acquire/release_packet and concurrency_max.

- [#2148](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2148)

  Add function length limits to our internal tidy tests.

### Features

- [#2080](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2080)

  New operations `query accounts` and `query transfers` as a stopgap API to add some degree of

  implementation, allowing non-blocking `open()`s while serving requests (which will be necessary
  during upgrade checks).

- [#1982](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1982)

  Require the `--experimental` flag when starting TigerBeetle with flags that aren't considered
  stable, that is, flags not explicitly documented in the help message, limiting the surface area
  for future compatibility.

## 2024-03-19

- Bump version to 0.15.x
- Starting with 0.15.x, TigerBeetle is ready for production use, preserves durability and
  provides a forward upgrade path through storage stability.

### Safety And Performance
- [#1755](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1755)

  Set TigerBeetle's block size to 512KB.

  Previously, we used to have a block size of 1MB to help with approximate pacing. Now that pacing
  can be tuned independently of block size, reduce this value (but not too much - make the roads
  wider than you think) to help with read amplification on queries.

### Safety And Performance

- [#1660](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1660)

  Implement compaction pacing: traditionally LSM databases run compaction on a background thread.
  In contrast compaction in tigerbeetle is deterministically interleaved with normal execution
  process, to get predictable latencies and to guarantee that ingress can never outrun compaction.

  In this PR, this "deterministic scheduling" is greatly improved, slicing compaction work into
  smaller bites which are more evenly distributed across a bar of batched requests.

- [#1722](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1722)

### Safety And Performance

- [#1584](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1584)
  Lower our memory usage by removing a redundant stash and not requiring a non-zero object cache

  The object cache is designed to help things like Account lookups, where the positive case can
  skip all the prefetch machinery, but it doesn't make as much sense for other Grooves.

  When a replica joins a view by receiving an SV message, some of the SV's headers may be too far

  During a view change, those headers are now eligible to be DVC headers.

  Panic on checkpoint divergence. Previously, if a replica's state on disk diverged, we'd

### Safety And Performance

- [#1346](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1346)

  The simulator found a failure when the WAL gets corrupted near a checkpoint boundary, leading us
  to also consider scenarios where corrupted blocks in the grid end up "intersecting" with
  corruption in the WAL, making the state unrecoverable where it should be. We fixed it by
  extending the durability of "prepares", evicting them from the WAL only when there's a quorum of
  checkpoints covering this "prepare".

- [#1366](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1366)

  Fix a unit test that regressed after we changed an undesirable behavior that allowed `prefetch`
  to invoke its callback synchronously.

- [#1381](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1381)

### Features

- [#1054](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1054)

  A highly anticipated feature lands on TigerBeetle: it's now possible to retrieve the transfers
  involved with a given account by using the new operation `get_account_transfers`.

  Note that this feature itself is an ad-hoc API intended to be replaced once we have a proper
  Querying API. The real improvement of this PR is the implementation of range queries, enabling
  us to land exciting new features on the next releases.

- [#1368](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1368)

  Bump the client's maximum limit and the default value of `concurrency_max` to fully take
  advantage of the batching logic.

- [#1359](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1359)

  We've established a rotation between the team for handling releases. As the one writing these
  release notes, I am now quite aware.

- [#1357](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1357)

  Fix panic in JVM unit test on Java 21. We test JNI functions even if they're not used by the Java
  client and the semantics have changed a bit since Java 11.

- [#1351](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1351),
  [#1356](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1356),
  [#1360](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1360)

  Move client sessions from the Superblock (database metadata) into the Grid (general storage). This
  simplifies control flow for various sub-components like Superblock checkpointing and Replica state
  sync.

### Safety And Performance

- [#1352](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1352)

  An optimization for removes on secondary indexes makes a return. Now tombstone values in the LSM
  can avoid being compacted all the way down to the lowest level if they can be cancelled out by
  inserts.

- [#1257](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1257)

  Clients automatically batch pending similar requests 🎉! If a tigerbeetle client submits a
  request, and one with the same operation is currently in-flight, they will be grouped and
  processed together where possible (currently, only for `CreateAccount` and `CreateTransfers`).
  This should [greatly improve the performance](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1257#issuecomment-1812648270)
  of workloads which submit a single operation at a time.

### Safety And Performance

- [#1339](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1339)

  Defense in depth: add checkpoint ID to prepare messages. Checkpoint ID is a hash that covers, via
  hash chaining, the entire state stored in the data file. Verifying that checkpoint IDs match
  provides a direct strong cryptographic guarantee that the state is the same across replicas, on
  top of existing guarantee that the sequence of events leading to the state is identical.

  [#1340](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1340)

  Gate the main branch on more checks: unit-tests for NodeJS and even more fuzzers.

- [#1332](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1332),
  [#1348](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1348)

### Safety And Performance

- [#1330](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1330),
  [#1319](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1319)

  Fix free set index. The free set is a bitset of free blocks in the grid. To speed up block
  allocation, the free set also maintains an index --- a coarser-grained bitset where a single bit
  corresponds to 1024 blocks. Maintaining consistency between a data structure and its index is
  hard, and thorough assertions are crucial. When moving free set to the grid, we discovered that,
  in fact, we don't have enough assertions in this area and, as a result, even have a bug!
  Assertions added, bug removed!

- [#1323](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1323),
  [#1336](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1336),
  [#1324](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1324)

  LSM tree fuzzer found a couple of bugs in its own code.

### Features

- [#1331](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1331),
  [#1322](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1322),
  [#1328](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1328)

  Remove format-time limit on the size of the data file. Before, the maximum size of the data file
  affected the layout of the superblock, and there wasn't any good way to increase this limit, short
  of recreating the cluster from scratch. Now, this limit only applies to the in-memory data
  structures: when a data files grows large, it is sufficient to just restart its replica with a
  larger amount of RAM.

- [#1321](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1321).

  We finally have the "installation" page in our docs!

### Internals

- [#1334](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1334)

  Use Zig's new `if (@inComptime())` builtin to compute checksum of an empty byte slice at compile
  time.

- [#1315](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1315)

  Fix unit tests for the Go client and add them to
  [not rocket science](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html)
  set of checks.

### Internals

- [#1306](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1306),
  [#1308](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1308)

  When validating our releases, use the `release` branch instead of `main` to ensure everything is
  in sync, and give the Java validation some retry logic to allow for delays in publishing to
  Central.

- [#1310](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1310)

  Pad storage checksums from 128-bit to 256-bit. These are currently unused, but we're reserving
  the space for AEAD tags in future.

- [#1312](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1312)

  Remove a trailing comma in our Java client sample code.

- [#1313](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1313)

  Switch `bootstrap.sh` to use spaces only for indentation and ensure it's checked by our
  shellcheck lint.

- [#1314](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1314)

  Update our `DESIGN.md` to better reflect storage fault probabilities and add in a reference.

- [#1316](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1316)

  Add `CHANGELOG.md` validation to our tidy lint script. We now check line length limits and
  trailing whitespace.

- [#1317](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1317)

  In keeping with TigerStyle rename `reserved_nonce` to `nonce_reserved`.

- [#1318](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1318)

  Note in TigerStyle that callbacks go last in the list of parameters.

- [#1325](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1325)

  Add an exception for line length limits if there's a link in said line.

### Safety And Performance

- [#1300](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1300)

  Recursively check for padding in structs used for data serialization, ensuring that no
  uninitialized bytes can be stored or transmitted over the network. Previously, we checked only
  if the struct had no padding, but not its fields.

### Internals

- [#1299](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1299)

  Minor adjustments in the release process, making it easier to track updates in the documentation
  website when a new version is released, even if there are no changes in the documentation itself.

- [#1301](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1301)

  Fix outdated documentation regarding 128-bit balances.

- [#1302](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1302)

  Fix a [bug](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/issues/1290) discovered and reported
  during the [Hackathon 2023](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/hackathon-2023), where the Node.js
  client's error messages were truncated due to an incorrect string concatenation adding a null
  byte `0x00` in the middle of the string.

- [#1291](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1291)

  Update the Node.js samples instructions, guiding the user to install all dependencies before
  the sample project.

- [#1295](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1295)

  We've doubled the `Header`s size to 256 bytes, paving the way for future improvements that will
  require extra space. Concurrently, this change also refactors a great deal of code.
  Some of the `Header`'s fields are shared by all messages, however, each `Command` also requires
  specific pieces of information that are only used by its kind of message, and it was necessary to
  repurpose and reinterpret fields so that the same header could hold different data depending on
  the context. Now, commands have their own specialized data type containing the fields that are
  only pertinent to the context, making the API much safer and intent-clear.

- [#1304](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1304)

  With larger headers (see #1295) we have enough room to make the cluster ID a 128-bit integer,
  allowing operators to generate random cluster IDs without the cost of having a centralized ID
  coordinator. Also updates the documentation and sample programs to reflect the new maximum batch
  size, which was reduced from 8191 to 8190 items after we doubled the header.

### Safety And Performance

- [#1264](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1264)

  Implement last-mile release artifact verification in CI.

- [#1268](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1268)

  Bump the simulator's safety phase max-ticks to avoid false positives from the liveness check.

- [#1270](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1270)

  Fix a crash caused by a race between a commit and a repair acquiring a client-reply `Write`.

- [#1278](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1278)

  Fix a crash caused by a race between state (table) sync and a move-table compaction.

  Both bugs didn't stand a chance in the [Line of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq-G3EWO9XM)
  of our deterministic simulator!

### Internals

- [#1244](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1244)

  Specify which CPU features are supported in builds.

- [#1275](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1275)

  Improve `shell.zig`'s directory handling, to guard against mistakes with respect to the current
  working directory.

- [#1277](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1277)

  Interpret a git hash as a VOPR seed, to enable reproducible simulator smoke tests in CI.

- [#1288](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1288)

  Explicitly target glibc 2.7 when building client libraries, to make sure TigerBeetle clients are
  compatible with older distributions.

### Features

- [#1260](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1260)

  Set the latest Docker image to track the latest release. Avoids language clients going out of sync
  with your default docker replica installations.

### Internals

- [#1261](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1261)

  Move website doc generation for https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/ into the main repo.

- [#1265](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1265),
  [#1243](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1243)

  Addressed some release quirks with the .NET and Go client builds.

## 2023-10-30

### Safety And Performance

- [#1251](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1251)

  Prove a tighter upper bound for the size of manifest log. With this new bound, manifest log is
  guaranteed to fit in allocated memory and is smaller. Additionally, manifest log compaction is
  paced depending on the current length of the log, balancing throughput and time-to-recovery.

- [#1198](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1198)

  Recommend using [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec) for event IDs. ULIDs are approximately
  sorted, which significantly improves common-case performance.

### Internals

- [#1218](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1218)

  Rewrite Node.js client implementation to use the common C client underneath. While clients for
  other languages already use the underlying C library, the Node.js client duplicated some code for
  historical reasons, but now we can leave that duplication in the past. [This Is A
  Photograph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0i7whWLW8M).

## 2023-10-25

### Safety And Performance

- [#1240](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1240)

  Increase block size to reduce latencies due to compaction work. Today, we use a simplistic
  schedule for compaction, which causes latency spikes at the end of the bar. While the future
  solution will implement a smarter compaction pacing to distribute the work more evenly, we can
  get a quick win by tweaking the block and the bar size, which naturally evens out latency spikes.

- [#1246](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1246)

  The new release process changed the names of the published artifacts (the version is no longer
  included in the name). This broke our quick start scripts, which we have fixed. Note that we are
  in the process of rolling out the new release process, so some unexpected breakage is expected.

- [#1239](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1239),
  [#1243](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1243)

  Speed up secondary index maintenance by statically distinguishing between insertions and
  updates. [Faster than the speed of night!](https://open.spotify.com/track/30oZqbcUROFLSru3WcN3bx)

### Features

- [#1245](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1245)

  Include Docker images in the release.

### Internals

- [#1234](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1234)

  Simplify superblock layout by using a linked list of blocks for manifest log, so that the
  superblock needs to store only two block references.

  P.S. Note the PR number!

## 2023-10-23

This is the start of the changelog. A lot happened before this point and is lost in the mist of git
history, but any notable change from this point on shall be captured by this document.

### Safety And Performance

- [#1225](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1225)

  Remove bloom filters. TigerBeetle implements more targeted optimizations for
  both positive and negative lookups, making bloom filters a net loss.

### Features

- [#1228](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1228)

  Increase alignment of data blocks to 128KiB (from 512 bytes). Larger alignment gives operators
  better control over physical layout of data on disk.

### Internals

- [#1201](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1201),
  [#1232](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1232)

  Overhaul of CI and release infrastructure. CI and releases are now driven by Zig code. The main
  branch is gated on integration tests for all clients.

  This is done in preparation for the first TigerBeetle release.
