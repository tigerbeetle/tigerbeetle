# Deploying

TigerBeetle is a single, statically linked binary without external dependencies, so the overall
deployment procedure is simple:

- Get the `tigerbeetle` binary onto each of the cluster's machines (see
  [Installing](../installing.md)).
- Format the data files, specifying cluster id, replica count, and replica index.
- Start replicas, specifying path to the data file and addresses of all replicas in the cluster.

Here's how to deploy a three replica cluster running on a single machine:

```console
curl -Lo tigerbeetle.zip https://linux.tigerbeetle.com && unzip tigerbeetle.zip && ./tigerbeetle version
./tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica-count=3 --replica=0 ./0_0.tigerbeetle
./tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica-count=3 --replica=1 ./0_1.tigerbeetle
./tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica-count=3 --replica=2 ./0_2.tigerbeetle

./tigerbeetle start --addresses=127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002 ./0_0.tigerbeetle &
./tigerbeetle start --addresses=127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002 ./0_1.tigerbeetle &
./tigerbeetle start --addresses=127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002 ./0_2.tigerbeetle &
```

Here's what the arguments mean:

* `--cluster` specifies a globally unique 128 bit cluster ID. It is recommended to use a random
  number for a cluster id, cluster ID `0` is reserved for testing.
* `--replica-count` specifies the size of the cluster. In the current version of TigerBeetle,
  cluster size can not be changed after creation, but this limitation will be lifted in the future.
* `--replica` is a zero-based index of the current replica. While `--cluster` and `--replica-count`
  arguments must match across all replicas of the cluster, `--replica` arguments must be unique.
* `./0_0.tigerbeetle` is a path to the data file. It doesn't matter how you name it, but the
  suggested naming schema is `${CLUSTER_ID}_${REPLICA_INDEX}.tigerbeetle`.
* `--addresses` specify IP addresses of all the replicas in the cluster. **The order of addresses
  must correspond to the order of replicas**. In particular,  the `--addresses` argument must be the
  same for all replicas and all clients, and the address at the replica index must correspond to
  replica's own address. 

Production deployment differs in three aspects (see [Cluster Recommendations](../cluster.md)):

- Each replica runs on a dedicated machine.
- Six replicas are used rather than three.
- There's a supervisor process to restart a replica process after a crash.

## Deployment Recipes

We have recipes for some commonly used deployment tools:

- [systemd](./systemd.md)
- [Docker](./docker.md)
- [Managed](./managed-service.md)
