# `create_transfers`

Create one or more [`Transfer`](../transfers.md)s. A successfully created transfer will modify the
amount fields of its [debit](../transfers.md#debit_account_id) and
[credit](../transfers.md#credit_account_id) accounts.

## Examples

- [Currency Exchange](../../recipes/currency-exchange.md)

## Event

The transfer to create. See [`Transfer`](../transfers.md) for constraints.

## Result

Results are listed in this section in order of descending precedence — that is, if more than one
error is applicable to the transfer being created, only the result listed first is returned.

### `ok`
The transfer was successfully created; did not previously exist.

Note that `ok` is generated by the client implementation; the network protocol does not include a
result when the transfer was successfully created.

### `linked_event_failed`
The transfer was not created.
One or more of the other transfers in the [linked chain](../transfers.md#flagslinked) is invalid, so
the whole chain failed.

### `linked_event_chain_open`
The transfer was not created.
The [`Transfer.flags.linked`](../transfers.md#flagslinked) flag was set on the last event in the
batch, which is not legal. (`flags.linked` indicates that the chain continues to the next
operation).

### `reserved_flag`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.flags.reserved`](../transfers.md#flagsreserved) is nonzero, but must be zero.

### `reserved_field`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.reserved`](../transfers.md#reserved) is nonzero, but must be zero.

### `id_must_not_be_zero`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.id`](../transfers.md#id) is zero, which is a reserved value.

### `id_must_not_be_int_max`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.id`](../transfers.md#id) is `2^128 - 1`, which is a reserved value.

### `debit_account_id_must_not_be_zero`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.debit_account_id`](../transfers.md#debit_account_id) is zero, but must be a valid
account id.

### `debit_account_id_must_not_be_int_max`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.debit_account_id`](../transfers.md#debit_account_id) is `2^128 - 1`, but must be a
valid account id.

### `credit_account_id_must_not_be_zero`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.credit_account_id`](../transfers.md#credit_account_id) is zero, but must be a valid
account id.

### `credit_account_id_must_not_be_int_max`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.credit_account_id`](../transfers.md#credit_account_id) is `2^128 - 1`, but must be a
valid account id.

### `accounts_must_be_different`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.debit_account_id`](../transfers.md#debit_account_id) and
[`Transfer.credit_account_id`](../transfers.md#credit_account_id) must not be equal.

That is, an account cannot transfer money to itself.

### `pending_id_must_be_zero`
The transfer was not created.
Only post/void transfers can reference a pending transfer.

Either:
- [`Transfer.flags.post_pending_transfer`](../transfers.md#flagspost_pending_transfer) must be set, or
- [`Transfer.flags.void_pending_transfer`](../transfers.md#flagsvoid_pending_transfer) must be set, or
- [`Transfer.pending_id`](../transfers.md#pending_id) must be zero.

### `pending_transfer_must_timeout`
The transfer was not created.
[Transfer.timeout](../transfers.md#timeout) is zero, but must nonzero for pending transfers.

### `ledger_must_not_be_zero`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.ledger`](../transfers.md#ledger) is zero, but must be nonzero.

### `code_must_not_be_zero`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.code`](../transfers.md#code) is zero, but must be nonzero.

### `amount_must_not_be_zero`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.amount`](../transfers.md#amount) is zero, but must be nonzero.

Every transfer must move value.
Only posting and voiding transfer amounts may be zero — when zero, they will move the full pending
amount.

### `debit_account_not_found`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.debit_account_id`](../transfers.md#debit_account_id) must refer to an existing `Account`.

### `credit_account_not_found`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.credit_account_id`](../transfers.md#credit_account_id) must refer to an existing `Account`.

### `accounts_must_have_the_same_ledger`
The transfer was not created. The accounts referred to by
[`Transfer.debit_account_id`](../transfers.md#debit_account_id) and
[`Transfer.credit_account_id`](../transfers.md#credit_account_id) must have an identical
[`ledger`](../accounts.md#ledger).

[Currency exchange](../../recipes/currency-exchange.md) is implemented with multiple transfers.

### `transfer_must_have_the_same_ledger_as_accounts`
The transfer was not created. The accounts referred to by
[`Transfer.debit_account_id`](../transfers.md#debit_account_id) and
[`Transfer.credit_account_id`](../transfers.md#credit_account_id) are equivalent, but
differ from the [`Transfer.ledger`](../transfers.md#ledger).

### `exists_with_different_flags`
A transfer with the same `id` already exists, but with different [`flags`](../transfers.md#flags).

### `exists_with_different_debit_account_id`
A transfer with the same `id` already exists, but with a different
[`debit_account_id`](../transfers.md#debit_account_id).

### `exists_with_different_credit_account_id`
A transfer with the same `id` already exists, but with a different
[`credit_account_id`](../transfers.md#credit_account_id).

### `exists_with_different_user_data`
A transfer with the same `id` already exists, but with a different
[`user_data`](../transfers.md#user_data).

### `exists_with_different_pending_id`
A transfer with the same `id` already exists, but with a different
[`pending_id`](../transfers.md#pending_id).

### `exists_with_different_timeout`
A transfer with the same `id` already exists, but with a different
[`timeout`](../transfers.md#timeout).

### `exists_with_different_code`
A transfer with the same `id` already exists, but with a different [`code`](../transfers.md#code).

### `exists_with_different_amount`
A transfer with the same `id` already exists, but with a different
[`amount`](../transfers.md#amount).

### `exists`
A transfer with the same `id` already exists, and is identical to the transfer in the request.

To correctly recover from application crashes
[many applications](../../usage/integration.md#conistency-with-foreign-databases) should handle
`exists` exactly as [`ok`](#ok).

### `overflows_debits_pending`
The transfer was not created.
`debit_account.debits_pending + transfer.amount` would overflow a 64-bit unsigned integer.

### `overflows_credits_pending`
The transfer was not created.
`credit_account.credits_pending + transfer.amount` would overflow a 64-bit unsigned integer.

### `overflows_debits_posted`
The transfer was not created.
`debit_account.debits_posted + transfer.amount` would overflow a 64-bit unsigned integer.

### `overflows_credits_posted`
The transfer was not created.
`debit_account.credits_posted + transfer.amount` would overflow a 64-bit unsigned integer.

### `overflows_debits`
The transfer was not created.
`debit_account.debits_pending + debit_account.debits_posted + transfer.amount`
would overflow a 64-bit unsigned integer.

### `overflows_credits`
The transfer was not created.
`credit_account.credits_pending + credit_account.credits_posted + transfer.amount`
would overflow a 64-bit unsigned integer.

### `overflows_timeout`
The transfer was not created.
`transfer.timestamp + transfer.timeout` would overflow a 64-bit unsigned integer.

This computation uses the [`Transfer.timestamp`](../transfers.md#timestamp) value assigned by the
replica, not the `0` value sent by the client.

### `exceeds_credits`
The transfer was not created.
The [debit account](../transfers.md#debit_account_id) has
[`flags.debits_must_not_exceed_credits`](../transfers.md#debits_must_not_exceed_credits) set,
but `debit_account.debits_pending + debit_account.debits_posted + transfer.amount`
would exceed `debit_account.credits_posted`.

### `exceeds_debits`
The transfer was not created.
The [credit account](../transfers.md#credit_account_id) has
[`flags.credits_must_not_exceed_debits`](../transfers.md#credits_must_not_exceed_debits) set,
but `credit_account.debits_pending + credit_account.debits_posted + transfer.amount`
would exceed `credit_account.debits_posted`.

### `cannot_post_and_void_pending_transfer`
The transfer was not created.
[`flags.post_pending_transfer`](../transfers.md#flagspost_pending_transfer) and
[`flags.void_pending_transfer`](../transfers.md#flagsvoid_pending_transfer) are mutually exclusive.

### `pending_transfer_cannot_post_or_void_another`
The transfer was not created.
[`flags.pending`](../transfers.md#flagspending) is mutually exclusive with
[`flags.post_pending_transfer`](../transfers.md#flagspost_pending_transfer) and
[`flags.void_pending_transfer`](../transfers.md#flagsvoid_pending_transfer).

### `timeout_reserved_for_pending_transfer`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.timeout`](../transfers.md#timeout) is nonzero, but only
[pending](../transfers.md#flagspending) transfers have nonzero timeouts.

### `pending_id_must_not_be_zero`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.flags.post_pending_transfer`](../transfers.md#flagspost_pending_transfer) or
[`Transfer.flags.void_pending_transfer`](../transfers.md#flagsvoid_pending_transfer) is set,
but [`Transfer.pending_id`](../transfers.md#pending_id) is zero. A posting or voiding transfer must
reference a [`pending`](../transfers.md#flagspending) transfer.

### `pending_id_must_not_be_int_max`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.pending_id`](../transfers.md#pending_id) is `2^128 - 1`, which is a reserved value.

### `pending_id_must_be_different`
The transfer was not created.
[`Transfer.pending_id`](../transfers.md#pending_id) is set to the same id as
[`Transfer.id`](../transfers.md#id). Instead it should refer to a different (existing) transfer.

### `pending_transfer_not_found`
The transfer was not created.
The transfer referenced by [`Transfer.pending_id`](../transfers.md#pending_id) does not exist.

### `pending_transfer_not_pending`
The transfer was not created.
The transfer referenced by [`Transfer.pending_id`](../transfers.md#pending_id) exists, but does not
have [`flags.pending`](../transfers.md#flagspending) set.

### `pending_transfer_has_different_debit_account_id`
The transfer was not created.
The transfer referenced by [`Transfer.pending_id`](../transfers.md#pending_id) exists, but with a
different [`debit_account_id`](../transfers.md#debit_account_id).

The post/void transfer's `debit_account_id` must either be `0` or identical to the pending
transfer's `debit_account_id`.

### `pending_transfer_has_different_credit_account_id`
The transfer was not created.
The transfer referenced by [`Transfer.pending_id`](../transfers.md#pending_id) exists, but with a
different [`credit_account_id`](../transfers.md#credit_account_id).

The post/void transfer's `credit_account_id` must either be `0` or identical to the pending
transfer's `credit_account_id`.

### `pending_transfer_has_different_ledger`
The transfer was not created.
The transfer referenced by [`Transfer.pending_id`](../transfers.md#pending_id) exists, but with a
different [`ledger`](../transfers.md#ledger).

The post/void transfer's `ledger` must either be `0` or identical to the pending
transfer's `ledger`.

### `pending_transfer_has_different_code`
The transfer was not created.
The transfer referenced by [`Transfer.pending_id`](../transfers.md#pending_id) exists, but with a
different [`code`](../transfers.md#code).

The post/void transfer's `code` must either be `0` or identical to the pending
transfer's `code`.

### `exceeds_pending_transfer_amount`
The transfer was not created.
The transfer's [`amount`](../transfers.md#amount) exceeds the `amount` of its
[pending](../transfers.md#pending_id) transfer.

### `pending_transfer_has_different_amount`
The transfer was not created.
The transfer is attempting to [void](../transfers.md#flagsvoid_pending_transfer) a pending transfer.
The voiding transfer's [`amount`](../transfers.md#amount) must be either `0` or exactly the `amount`
of the pending transfer.

To partially void a transfer, create a [posting transfer](../transfers.md#flagspost_pending_transfer)
with an amount between `0` and the pending transfer's `amount`.

### `pending_transfer_already_posted`
The transfer was not created.
The referenced [pending](../transfers.md#pending_id) transfer was already posted by a
[`post_pending_transfer`](../transfers.md#flagspost_pending_transfer).

### `pending_transfer_already_voided`
The transfer was not created.
The referenced [pending](../transfers.md#pending_id) transfer was already voided by a
[`void_pending_transfer`](../transfers.md#flagsvoid_pending_transfer).

### `pending_transfer_expired`
The transfer was not created.
The referenced [pending](../transfers.md#pending_id) transfer was already voided because its
[timeout](../transfers.md#timeout) has passed.
