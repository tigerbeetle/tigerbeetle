# Data Modeling

This section describes various aspects of the TigerBeetle data model and provides some suggestions
for how you can map your application's requirements onto the data model.

## Accounts, Transfers, and Ledgers

The TigerBeetle data model consists of [`Account`s](../reference/account.md),
[`Transfer`s](../reference/transfer.md), and ledgers.

### Ledgers

Ledgers partition accounts into groups that may represent a currency or asset type or any other
logical grouping. Only accounts on the same ledger can transact directly, but you can use atomically
linked transfers to implement [currency exchange](./recipes/currency-exchange.md).

Ledgers are only stored in TigerBeetle as a numeric identifier on the
[account](../reference/account.md#ledger) and [transfer](../reference/transfer.md) data
structures. You may want to store additional metadata about each ledger in a control plane
[database](./system-architecture.md).

You can also use different ledgers to further partition accounts, beyond asset type. For example, if
you have a multi-tenant setup where you are tracking balances for your customers' end-users, you
might have a ledger for each of your customers. If customers have end-user accounts in multiple
currencies, each of your customers would have multiple ledgers.

## Debits vs Credits

TigerBeetle tracks each account's cumulative posted debits and cumulative posted credits. In
double-entry accounting, an account balance is the difference between the two — computed as either
`debits - credits` or `credits - debits`, depending on the type of account. It is up to the
application to compute the balance from the cumulative debits/credits.

From the database's perspective the distinction is arbitrary, but accounting conventions recommend
using a certain balance type for certain types of accounts.

If you are new to thinking in terms of debits and credits, read the
[deep dive on financial accounting](./financial-accounting.md) to get a better understanding of
double-entry bookkeeping and the different types of accounts.

### Debit Balances

`balance = debits - credits`

By convention, debit balances are used to represent:

- Operator's Assets
- Operator's Expenses

To enforce a positive (non-negative) debit balance, use
[`flags.credits_must_not_exceed_debits`](../reference/account.md#flagscredits_must_not_exceed_debits).

To keep an account's balance between an upper and lower bound, see the
[Balance Bounds recipe](./recipes/balance-bounds.md).

### Credit Balances

`balance = credits - debits`

By convention, credit balances are used to represent:

- Operator's Liabilities
- Equity in the Operator's Business
- Operator's Income

To enforce a positive (non-negative) credit balance, use
[`flags.debits_must_not_exceed_credits`](../reference/account.md#flagsdebits_must_not_exceed_credits).
For example, a customer account that is represented as an Operator's Liability would use this flag
to ensure that the balance cannot go negative.

To keep an account's balance between an upper and lower bound, see the
[Balance Bounds recipe](./recipes/balance-bounds.md).

### Compound Transfers

`Transfer`s in TigerBeetle debit a single account and credit a single account. You can read more
about implementing compound transfers in
[Multi-Debit, Multi-Credit Transfers](./recipes/multi-debit-credit-transfers.md).

## Fractional Amounts and Asset Scale

To maximize precision and efficiency, [`Account`](../reference/account.md) debits/credits and
[`Transfer`](../reference/transfer.md) amounts are unsigned 128-bit integers. However,
currencies are often denominated in fractional amounts.

To represent a fractional amount in TigerBeetle, **map the smallest useful unit of the fractional
currency to 1**. Consider all amounts in TigerBeetle as a multiple of that unit.

Applications may rescale the integer amounts as necessary when rendering or interfacing with other
systems. But when working with fractional amounts, calculations should be performed on the integers
to avoid loss of precision due to floating-point approximations.

### Asset Scale

When the multiplier is a power of 10 (e.g. `10 ^ n`), then the exponent `n` is referred to as an
_asset scale_. For example, representing USD in cents uses an asset scale of `2`.

#### Examples

- `1 USD` = `100` cents. Using an asset scale of `2`,
  - The fractional amount `0.45 USD` is represented as the integer `45`.
  - The fractional amount `123.00 USD` is represented as the integer `12300`.
  - The fractional amount `123.45 USD` is represented as the integer `12345`.

- `1 JPY` = `1` yen. Using an asset scale of `0`,
  - The fractional amount `123 JPY` is represented as the integer `123`.

- `1 KWD` = `1000` fils. Using an asset scale of `3`,
  - The fractional amount `0.450 KWD` is represented as the integer `450`.
  - The fractional amount `123.000 KWD` is represented as the integer `123000`.
  - The fractional amount `123.450 KWD` is represented as the integer `123450`.

The other direction works as well. If the smallest useful unit of an asset is `10, 000, 000` units,
then it can be scaled down to the integer `1` using an asset scale of `-7`.

### ⚠️ Asset Scales Cannot Be Easily Changed

When setting your asset scales, we recommend thinking about whether your application may _ever_
require a larger asset scale. If so, we would recommend using that larger scale from the start.

For example, it might seem natural to use an asset scale of 2 for many currencies. However, it may
be wise to use a higher scale in case you ever need to represent smaller fractions of that asset.

Accounts and transfers are immutable once created. In order to change the asset scale of a ledger,
you would need to use a different `ledger` number and duplicate all the accounts on that ledger over
to the new one.

## `user_data`

`user_data_128`, `user_data_64` and `user_data_32` are the most flexible fields in the schema (for
both [accounts](../reference/account.md) and [transfers](../reference/transfer.md)). Each
`user_data` field's contents are arbitrary, interpreted only by the application.

Each `user_data` field is indexed for efficient point and range queries.

While the usage of each field is entirely up to you, one way of thinking about each of the fields
is:

- `user_data_128` - this might store the "who" and/or "what" of a transfer. For example, it could be
  a pointer to a business entity stored within the
  [control plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_plane) database.
- `user_data_64` - this might store a second timestamp for "when" the transaction originated in the
  real world, rather than when the transfer was
  [timestamped by TigerBeetle](./time.md#why-tigerbeetle-manages-timestamps). This can be used if
  you need to model [bitemporality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitemporal_modeling).
  Alternatively, if you do not need this to be used for a timestamp, you could use this field in
  place of the `user_data_128` to store the "who"/"what".
- `user_data_32` - this might store the "where" of a transfer. For example, it could store the
  jurisdiction where the transaction originated in the real world. In certain cases, such as for
  cross-border remittances, it might not be enough to have the UTC timestamp and you may want to
  know the transfer's locale.

(Note that the [`code`](#code) can be used to encode the "why" of a transfer.)

Any of the `user_data` fields can be used as a group identifier for objects that will be queried
together. For example, for multiple transfers used for
[currency exchange](./recipes/currency-exchange.md).

## `id`

The `id` field uniquely identifies each [`Account`](../reference/account.md#id) and
[`Transfer`](../reference/transfer.md#id) within the cluster.

The primary purpose of an `id` is to serve as an "idempotency key" — to avoid executing an event
twice. For example, if a client creates a transfer but the server's reply is lost, the client (or
application) will retry — the database must not transfer the money twice.

Note that `id`s are unique per cluster -- not per ledger. You should attach a separate identifier in
the [`user_data`](#user_data) field if you want to store a connection between multiple `Account`s or
multiple `Transfer`s that are related to one another. For example, different currency `Account`s
belonging to the same user or multiple `Transfer`s that are part of a
[currency exchange](./recipes/currency-exchange.md).

[TigerBeetle Time-Based Identifiers](#tigerbeetle-time-based-identifiers-recommended) are
recommended for most applications.

When selecting an `id` scheme:

- Idempotency is particularly important (and difficult) in the context of
  [application crash recovery](./reliable-transaction-submission.md).
- Be careful to [avoid `id` collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem).
- An account and a transfer may share the same `id` (they belong to different "namespaces"), but
  this is not recommended because other systems (that you may later connect to TigerBeetle) may use
  a single "namespace" for all objects.
- Avoid requiring a central oracle to generate each unique `id` (e.g. an auto-increment field in
  SQL). A central oracle may become a performance bottleneck when creating accounts/transfers.
- Sequences of identifiers with long runs of strictly increasing (or strictly decreasing) values are
  amenable to optimization, leading to higher database throughput.
- Random identifiers are not recommended – they can't take advantage of all of the LSM
  optimizations. (Random identifiers have ~10% lower throughput than strictly-increasing ULIDs).

### TigerBeetle Time-Based Identifiers (Recommended)

TigerBeetle recommends using a specific ID scheme for most applications. It is time-based and
lexicographically sortable. The scheme is inspired by ULIDs and UUIDv7s but is better able to take
advantage of LSM optimizations, which leads to higher database throughput.

TigerBeetle clients include an `id()` function to generate IDs using the recommended scheme.

TigerBeetle ID is a 128-bit number where:

- the high 48 bits are a millisecond timestamp
- the low 80 bits are random

```
id = (timestamp << 80) | random
```

When creating multiple objects during the same millisecond, we increment the random bytes rather
than generating new random bytes. These details ensure that a sequence of objects have strictly
increasing IDs according to the server, which improves database optimization.

Similar to ULIDs and UUIDv7s, these IDs have the following benefits:

- they have an insignificant risk of collision.
- they do not require a central oracle to generate.

### Reuse Foreign Identifier

This technique is most appropriate when integrating TigerBeetle with an existing application where
TigerBeetle accounts or transfers map one-to-one with an entity in the foreign database.

Set `id` to a "foreign key" — that is, reuse an identifier of a corresponding object from another
database. For example, if every user (within the application's database) has a single account, then
the identifier within the foreign database can be used as the `Account.id` within TigerBeetle.

To reuse the foreign identifier, it must conform to TigerBeetle's `id`
[constraints](../reference/account.md#id).

## `code`

The `code` identifier represents the "why" for an Account or Transfer.

On an [`Account`](../reference/account.md#code), the `code` indicates the account type, such as
assets, liabilities, equity, income, or expenses, and subcategories within those classification.

On a [`Transfer`](../reference/transfer.md#code), the `code` indicates why a given transfer is
happening, such as a purchase, refund, currency exchange, etc.

When you start building out your application on top of TigerBeetle, you may find it helpful to list
out all of the known types of accounts and movements of funds and mapping each of these to `code`
numbers or ranges.
