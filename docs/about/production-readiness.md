## Production Readiness

TigerBeetle was started in 2020 and you're watching us build the plane while we're flying it.

We have already reached storage and protocol stability to ensure upgradable versions and backward
compatibility with the data file format. TigerBeetle _can_ be used in production on Linux, however
its API is still subject to breaking changes.

We encourage you to [try out TigerBeetle](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle#quickstart),
[follow our development](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle#short-term-roadmap), and [give
feedback](https://slack.tigerbeetle.com/invite)!
