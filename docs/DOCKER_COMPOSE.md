# Running a 3-node TigerBeetle cluster locally with Docker Compose

First, provision the data file for each node:

```
$ docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data ghcr.io/coilhq/tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica=0 /data/0_0.tigerbeetle
$ docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data ghcr.io/coilhq/tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica=1 /data/0_1.tigerbeetle
$ docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data ghcr.io/coilhq/tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica=2 /data/0_2.tigerbeetle
```

Then create a docker-compose.yml file:

```docker-compose
version: "3.7"

##
# Note: this example might only work with linux + using `network_mode:host` because of 2 reasons:
# 
# 1. When specifying an internal docker network, other containers are only available using dns based routing:
#    e.g. from tigerbeetle_0, the other replicas are available at `tigerbeetle_1:3002` and
#    `tigerbeetle_2:3003` respectively.
#
# 2. Tigerbeetle performs some validation of the ip address provided in the `--addresses` parameter
#    and won't let us specify a custom domain name.
#
# The workaround for now is to use `network_mode:host` in the containers instead of specifying our
# own internal docker network
##

services:
  tigerbeetle_0:
    container_name: tigerbeetle_0
    image: ghcr.io/coilhq/tigerbeetle
    command: "start --addresses=0.0.0.0:3001,0.0.0.0:3002,0.0.0.0:3003 /data/0_0.tigerbeetle"
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data

  tigerbeetle_1:
    container_name: tigerbeetle_1
    image: ghcr.io/coilhq/tigerbeetle
    command: "start --addresses=0.0.0.0:3001,0.0.0.0:3002,0.0.0.0:3003 /data/0_1.tigerbeetle"
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data

  tigerbeetle_2:
    container_name: tigerbeetle_2
    image: ghcr.io/coilhq/tigerbeetle
    command: "start --addresses=0.0.0.0:3001,0.0.0.0:3002,0.0.0.0:3003 /data/0_2.tigerbeetle"
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

And run it:

```
$ docker-compose up
docker-compose up
Starting tigerbeetle_0   ... done
Starting tigerbeetle_2   ... done
Recreating tigerbeetle_1 ... done
Attaching to tigerbeetle_0, tigerbeetle_2, tigerbeetle_1

tigerbeetle_2    | info(clock): 2: system time is 83ns ahead
tigerbeetle_1    | info(clock): 1: system time is 78ns ahead

... and so on ...
```

Now you can connect to TigerBeetle with any TigerBeetle client.
