Welcome, wanderer! You are looking at the TigerBeetle's internal documentation. If you want to _use_

If you want to learn how TigerBeetle works inside, here's what we got:

  all the code here!
- [HACKING](./HACKING.md) gets you up to speed with building the codebase and running the tests.
- [ARCHITECTURE](./ARCHITECTURE.md) is a one-page technical intro into TigerBeetle. If you are

  data is stored where and why.

  - [Upgrades](./upgrades.md) are just so cool, you must read this!
