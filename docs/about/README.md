# About TigerBeetle

## Mission

**We want to make it easy for others to build the next generation of financial services and
applications without having to cobble together an accounting or ledger system of record from
scratch.**

TigerBeetle implements the latest research and technology to deliver unprecedented safety,
durability and performance while reducing operational costs by orders of magnitude and providing a
fantastic developer experience.

## What is a tiger beetle?

Two things got us interested in tiger beetles as a species:

1. Tiger beetles are ridiculously fast... a tiger beetle can run at a speed of 9 km/h, about 125
   body lengths per second. That’s 20 times faster than an Olympic sprinter when you scale speed to
   body length, **a fantastic speed-to-size ratio**. To put this in perspective, a human would need
   to run at 480 miles per hour to keep up.

2. Tiger beetles thrive in different environments, from trees and woodland paths, to sea and lake
   shores, with the largest of tiger beetles living primarily in the dry regions of Southern
   Africa... and that's what we want for TigerBeetle, **something that's fast and safe to deploy
   everywhere**.

  that storage performance instability is not uncommon: 0.2% of the time, a disk is more than 2x
  slower than its peer drives in the same RAID group (and 0.6% for SSD). As a consequence, disk and
  SSD-based RAIDs experience at least one slow drive (i.e., storage tail) 1.5% and 2.2% of the time."
