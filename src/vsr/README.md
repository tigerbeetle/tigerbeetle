### Recovery

Unlike [VRR](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf), TigerBeetle does not implement Recovery Protocol (see §4.3).
Instead, replicas persist their VSR state to the superblock.
This ensures that a recovering replica never backtracks to an older view (from the point of view of the cluster).

## Protocol: Ping (Replica-Replica)

Replicas send `command=ping`/`command=pong` messages to one another to synchronize clocks.

## Protocol: Ping (Replica-Client)

Clients send `command=ping_client` (and receive `command=pong_client`) messages to (from) replicas to learn the cluster's current view.

## Protocol: Normal

Normal protocol prepares and commits requests (from clients) and sends replies (to clients).

1. The client sends a `command=request` message to the primary. (If the client's view is outdated, the receiver will forward the message on to the actual primary).
2. The primary converts the `command=request` to a `command=prepare` (assigning it an `op` and `timestamp`).
3. Each replica (in a chain beginning with the primary) performs the following steps concurrently:
    - Write the prepare to the WAL.
    - Forward the prepare to the next replica in the chain.
4. Each replica sends a `command=prepare_ok` message to the primary once it has written the prepare to the WAL.
5. When a primary collects a [replication quorum](#quorums) of `prepare_ok`s _and_ it has committed all preceding prepares, it commits the prepare.
6. The primary replies to the client.
7. The backups are informed that the prepare was committed by either:
    - a subsequent prepare, or
    - a periodic `command=commit` heartbeat message.

## Protocol: Start-View-Change

Start-View-Change (SVC) protocol initiates [view-changes](#protocol-view-change) with minimal disruption.

Unlike the Start-View-Change described in [VRR](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf) §4.2, this protocol runs in both `status=normal` and `status=view_change` (not just `status=view_change`).

1. Depending on the replica's status:
    - `status=normal` & primary: When the replica has not recently received a `prepare_ok` (and it has a prepare in flight), pause broadcasting `command=commit`.
    - `status=normal` & backup: When the replica has not recently received a `command=commit`, broadcast `command=start_view_change` to all replicas (including self).
    - `status=view_change`: If the replica has not completed a view-change recently, send a `command=start_view_change` to all replicas (including self).
2. (Periodically retry sending the SVC).
3. If the backup receives a `command=commit` or changes views (respectively), stop the `command=start_view_change` retries.
4. If the replica collects a [view-change quorum](#quorums) of SVC messages, transition to `status=view_change` for the next view. (That is, increment the replica's view and start sending a DVC).

This protocol approach enables liveness under asymmetric network partitions. For example, a replica which can send to the cluster but not receive may send SVCs, but if the remainder of the cluster is healthy, they will never achieve a quorum, so the view is stable. When the partition heals, the formerly-isolated replica may rejoin the original view (if it was isolated in `status=normal`) or a new view (if it was isolated in `status=view_change`).

## Protocol: View-Change

A replica sends `command=do_view_change` to all replicas, with the `view` it is attempting to start.
- The _primary_ of the `view` collects a [view-change quorum](#quorums) of DVCs.
- The _backup_ of the `view` uses to `do_view_change` to updates its current `view` (transitioning to `status=view_change`).

DVCs include headers from prepares which are:
- _present_ (in the replica's WAL) and valid
- _missing_ (never written to the replica's WAL)
- _corrupt_ (in the replica's WAL)

These cases are distinguished during [WAL repair](#protocol-repair-wal).

When the primary collects its quorum:
1. The primary installs the headers to its suffix.
2. Then the primary repairs its headers. ([Protocol: Repair Journal](#protocol-repair-journal)).
3. Then the primary repairs its prepares. ([Protocol: Repair WAL](#protocol-repair-wal)) (and potentially truncates uncommitted ops).
4. Then primary commits all prepares which are not known to be uncommitted.
5. Then the primary transitions to `status=normal` and broadcasts a `command=start_view`.

## Protocol: Request/Start View

### `request_start_view`

A backup sends a `command=request_start_view` to the primary of a view when any of the following occur:

  - the backup learns about a newer view via a `command=commit` message, or
  - the backup learns about a newer view via a `command=prepare` message, or
  - a replica recovers to `status=recovering_head`

### `start_view`

When a `status=normal` primary receives `command=request_start_view`, it replies with a `command=start_view`.
`command=start_view` includes the view's current suffix — the headers of the latest messages in the view.

Upon receiving a `start_view` for the new view, the backup installs the suffix, transitions to `status=normal`, and begins repair.

## Protocol: Repair Journal

`request_headers` and `headers` repair gaps or breaks in a replica's journal headers.
Repaired headers are a prerequisite for [repairing prepares](#protocol-repair-wal).

Because the headers are repaired backwards (from the head) by hash-chaining, it is safe for both backups and transitioning primaries.

Gaps/breaks in a replica's journal headers may occur:

  - On a backup, receiving nonconsecutive ops, leaving a gap in its headers.
  - On a backup, which has not finished repair.
  - On a new primary during a view-change, which has not finished repair.

## Protocol: Repair WAL

The replica's journal tracks which prepares the WAL requires — i.e. headers for which either:
- no prepare was ever received, or
- the prepare was received and written, but was since discovered to be corrupt

During repair, missing/damaged prepares are requested & repaired chronologically, which:
- improves the chances that older entries will be available, i.e. not yet overwritten
- enables better pipelining of repair and commit.

In response to a `request_prepare`:

- Reply the `command=prepare` with the requested prepare, if available and valid.
- Reply `command=nack_prepare` if the request origin is the primary of the ongoing view-change and we never received the prepare. (This enables the primary to truncate uncommitted messages and remain available).
- Otherwise do not reply. (e.g. the corresponding slot in the WAL is corrupt)

Per [PAR's CTRL Protocol](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/fast18/fast18-alagappan.pdf), we do not nack corrupt entries, since they _might_ be the prepare being requested.

## Protocol: Client

1. Client sends `command=request operation=register` to registers with the cluster by starting a new request-reply hashchain. (See also: [Protocol: Normal](#protocol-normal)).
2. Client receives `command=reply operation=register` from the cluster. (If the cluster is at the maximum number of clients, it evicts the oldest).
3. Repeat:
    1. Send `command=request` to cluster.
    2. If the client has been evicted, receive `command=eviction` from the cluster. (The client must re-register before sending more requests.)
    3. If the client has not been evicted, receive `command=reply` from cluster.

# Quorums

- The _replication quorum_ is the minimum number of replicas required to complete a commit.
- The _view-change quorum_ is the minimum number of replicas required to complete a view-change.

With the default configuration:

|      **Replica Count** |   1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |
| ---------------------: | --: | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: |
| **Replication Quorum** |   1 |  2 |  2 |  2 |  3 |  3 |
| **View-Change Quorum** |   1 |  2 |  2 |  3 |  3 |  4 |
