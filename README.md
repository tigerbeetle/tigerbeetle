## TigerBeetle (under active development)

TigerBeetle is not yet production-ready. The production version of
**TigerBeetle is now under active development**. Our [DESIGN
doc](docs/DESIGN.md) provides an overview of TigerBeetle's data
structures.

Check out our [short-term roadmap](#short-term-roadmap) below for where we're heading!

## Quickstart

TigerBeetle is easy to run with or without Docker, depending on your
preference. First, we'll cover running the [Single
Binary](#single-binary). And below that is how to run [with
Docker](#with-docker).

### Single Binary

Install TigerBeetle by grabbing the latest release from
GitHub.

#### Prebuilt Linux binary

```bash
$ curl -LO https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle/releases/download/2022-11-16-weekly/tigerbeetle-Linux-x64-2022-11-16-weekly.zip
$ unzip tigerbeetle-Linux-x64-2022-11-16-weekly.zip 
$ sudo cp tigerbeetle /usr/local/bin/tigerbeetle
$ tigerbeetle version --verbose | head -n6
TigerBeetle version experimental

git_commit="b47292aaf2492e6b56a977009b85f7fca6e66775"

zig_version=0.9.1
mode=Mode.ReleaseSafe
```

#### Prebuilt macOS binary

```bash
$ curl -LO https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle/releases/download/2022-11-16-weekly/tigerbeetle-macOS-x64-2022-11-16-weekly.zip
$ unzip tigerbeetle-macOS-x64-2022-11-16-weekly.zip 
$ sudo cp tigerbeetle /usr/local/bin/tigerbeetle
$ tigerbeetle version --verbose | head -n6
TigerBeetle version experimental

git_commit="b47292aaf2492e6b56a977009b85f7fca6e66775"

zig_version=0.9.1
mode=Mode.ReleaseSafe
```

#### Building from source

Or to build from source, clone the repo, checkout a release, and run
the install script.

You will need POSIX userland, curl or wget, tar, and xz.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle.git
$ cd tigerbeetle
$ git checkout 2022-11-16-weekly # Or latest tag
$ scripts/install.sh
```

Don't worry, this will only make changes within the `tigerbeetle`
directory. No global changes. The result will place the compiled
`tigerbeetle` binary into the current directory.

#### Running TigerBeetle

Then create the TigerBeetle data file.

```bash
$ ./tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica=0 0_0.tigerbeetle
info(io): creating "0_0.tigerbeetle"...
info(io): allocating 660.140625MiB...
```

And start the server.

```bash
$ ./tigerbeetle start --addresses=3000 0_0.tigerbeetle
info(io): opening "0_0.tigerbeetle"...
info(main): 0: cluster=0: listening on 127.0.0.1:3000
```

Now skip ahead to [Use Node as a CLI](#use-node-as-a-cli).

### With Docker

First provision TigerBeetle's data directory.

```bash
$ docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data ghcr.io/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle \
    format --cluster=0 --replica=0 /data/0_0.tigerbeetle
info(io): creating "0_0.tigerbeetle"...
info(io): allocating 660.140625MiB...
```

Then run the server.

```bash
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/data:/data ghcr.io/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle \
    start --addresses=0.0.0.0:3000 /data/0_0.tigerbeetle
info(io): opening "0_0.tigerbeetle"...
info(main): 0: cluster=0: listening on 0.0.0.0:3000
```

Note: if you are on macOS, you will need to call the Docker run
command with `--cap-add IPC_LOCK` or `--ulimit memlock=-1:-1`. See
[here](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/deployment/with-docker#error-systemresources-on-macos) for
more information.

### Use Node as a CLI

Now that you've got the server running with or without Docker, let's
connect to the running server and do some accounting!

First install the Node client.

```javascript
$ npm install -g tigerbeetle-node
```

Then create a client connection.

```javascript
$ node
Welcome to Node.js v16.14.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
> let { createClient } = require('tigerbeetle-node');
> let client = createClient({ cluster_id: 0, replica_addresses: ['3000'] });
info(message_bus): connected to replica 0
```

Now create two accounts. (Don't worry about the details, you can
read about them later.)

```javascript
> let errors = await client.createAccounts([
  {
    id: 1n,
    ledger: 1,
    code: 718,
    user_data: 0n,
    reserved: Buffer.alloc(48, 0),
    flags: 0,
    debits_pending: 0n,
    debits_posted: 0n,
    credits_pending: 0n,
    credits_posted: 0n,
    timestamp: 0n,
  },
  {
    id: 2n,
    ledger: 1,
    code: 718,
    user_data: 0n,
    reserved: Buffer.alloc(48, 0),
    flags: 0,
    debits_pending: 0n,
    debits_posted: 0n,
    credits_pending: 0n,
    credits_posted: 0n,
    timestamp: 0n,
  },
]);
> errors
[]
```

Now create a transfer of `10` (of some amount/currency) between the two accounts.

```javascript
> errors = await client.createTransfers([
  {
    id: 1n,
    debit_account_id: 1n,
    credit_account_id: 2n,
    pending_id: 0n,
    user_data: 0n,
    reserved: 0n,
    timeout: 0n,
    ledger: 1,
    code: 718,
    flags: 0,
    amount: 10n,
    timestamp: 0n,
  }
]);
```

Now, the amount of `10` has been credited to account `2` and debited
from account `1`. Let's query TigerBeetle for these two accounts to
verify!

```javascript
> let accounts = await client.lookupAccounts([1n, 2n]);
> console.log(accounts.map(a => ({
    id: a.id,
	debits_posted: a.debits_posted,
	credits_posted: a.credits_posted,
	timestamp: a.timestamp,
  })));
[
  {
    id: 1n,
    debits_posted: 10n,
    credits_posted: 0n,
    timestamp: 1662489240014463675n
  },
  {
    id: 2n,
    debits_posted: 0n,
    credits_posted: 10n,
    timestamp: 1662489240014463676n
  }
]
```

And indeed you can see that account `1` has `debits_posted` as `10`
and account `2` has `credits_posted` as `10`. The `10` amount is fully
accounted for!

$ cd tigerbeetle
$ scripts/install.sh
```

With TigerBeetle installed, you are ready to benchmark!

```bash
$ scripts/benchmark.sh
```

*If you encounter any benchmark errors, please send us the resulting `benchmark.log`.*

## Performance Demos

Along the way, we also put together a series of performance demos and sketches to get you comfortable building TigerBeetle, show how low-level code can sometimes be easier than high-level code, help you understand some of the key components within TigerBeetle, and enable back-of-the-envelope calculations to motivate design decisions.

You may be interested in:

* [demos/protobeetle](./demos/protobeetle), how batching changes everything.
* [demos/bitcast](./demos/bitcast), how Zig makes zero-overhead network deserialization easy, fast and safe.
* [demos/io_uring](./demos/io_uring), how ring buffers can eliminate kernel syscalls, reduce server hardware requirements by a factor of two, and change the way we think about event loops.
* [demos/hash_table](./demos/hash_table), how linear probing compares with cuckoo probing, and what we look for in a hash table that needs to scale to millions (and billions) of account transfers.

## Short-Term Roadmap

Done:

1. Consensus protocol readiness.

In progress:

2. Storage engine readiness.
  * Until this happens you'll occasionally see assertion failures in
    LSM code as we tune overtight or incorrect assertions, or as
    assertions detect bugs and shut TigerBeetle down safely.
  * See [#189](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle/issues/189) for details.
3. Recovery readiness.
  * See [#212](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle/issues/212) for details.
4. Support querying all transfers associated with an account id.
  * Until this is implemented you can only query individual accounts and transfers by id.
