# Currency Exchange

Some applications require multiple currencies. For example, a bank may hold balances in many
different currencies. If a single logical entity holds multiple currencies, each currency must be
held in a separate TigerBeetle `Account`. (Normalizing to a single currency at the application level
should be avoided because exchange rates fluctuate).

Currency exchange is a trade of one type of currency (denoted by the `ledger`) for another,
facilitated by an entity called the _liquidity provider_.

## Data Modeling

Distinct [`ledger`](../../reference/account.md#ledger) values denote different currencies (or
other asset types). Transfers between pairs of accounts with different `ledger`s are
[not permitted](../../reference/requests/create_transfers.md#accounts_must_have_the_same_ledger).

Instead, currency exchange is implemented by creating two
[atomically linked](../../reference/transfer.md#flagslinked) different-ledger transfers between
two pairs of same-ledger accounts.

A simple currency exchange involves four accounts:

- A _source account_ `A₁`, on ledger `1`.
- A _destination account_ `A₂`, on ledger `2`.
- A _source liquidity account_ `L₁`, on ledger `1`.
- A _destination liquidity account_ `L₂`, on ledger `2`.

and two linked transfers:

- A transfer `T₁` from the _source account_ to the _source liquidity account_.
- A transfer `T₂` from the _destination liquidity account_ to the _destination account_.

The transfer amounts vary according to the exchange rate.

- Both liquidity accounts belong to the liquidity provider (e.g. a bank or exchange).
- The source and destination accounts may belong to the same entity as one another, or different
  entities, depending on the use case.

### Example

Consider sending `100.00 USD` from account `A₁` (denominated in USD) to account `A₂` (denominated
in INR). Assuming an exchange rate of `1.00 USD = 82.42135 INR`, `100.00 USD = 8242.14 INR`:

| Ledger | Debit Account | Credit Account | Amount | `flags.linked` |
| -----: | ------------: | -------------: | -----: | -------------: |
|    USD |          `A₁` |           `L₁` |  10000 |           true |
|    INR |          `L₂` |           `A₂` | 824214 |          false |

- Amounts are [represented as integers](../data-modeling.md#fractional-amounts-and-asset-scale).
- Because both liquidity accounts belong to the same entity, the entity does not lose money on the
  transaction.
  - If the exchange rate is precise, the entity breaks even.
  - If the exchange rate is not precise, the application should round in favor of the liquidity
    account to deter arbitrage.
- Because the two transfers are linked together, they will either both succeed or both fail.

## Spread

In the prior example, the liquidity provider breaks even. A fee (i.e. spread) can be included in the
`linked` chain as a separate transfer from the source account to the source liquidity account (`A₁`
to `L₁`).

This is preferable to simply modifying the exchange rate in the liquidity provider's favor because
it implicitly records the exchange rate and spread at the time of the exchange — information that
cannot be derived if the two are combined.

### Example

This depicts the same scenario as the prior example, except the liquidity provider charges a `0.10 USD`
fee for the transaction.

| Ledger | Debit Account | Credit Account | Amount | `flags.linked` |
| -----: | ------------: | -------------: | -----: | -------------: |
|    USD |          `A₁` |           `L₁` |  10000 |           true |
|    USD |          `A₁` |           `L₁` |     10 |           true |
|    INR |          `L₂` |           `A₂` | 824214 |          false |
