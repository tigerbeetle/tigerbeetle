# TigerBeetle Changelog

## 2024-08-05 (No release: Queued up to improve multiversion upgrade flow)

### Safety And Performance

- [#2162](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2162)

  Past release checksums are further validated when printing multi-version information.

- [#2143](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2143)

  Write Ahead Log (WAL) appending was decoupled from WAL replication, tightening asserts.

- [#2153](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2153),
  [#2170](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2170)

  VSR eviction edge cases receive more hardening.

### Safety And Performance

- [#2140](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2140),
  [#2154](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2154)

  Fix a bug where MessageBus sees block/reply messages (due to state sync or repair) and peer_type
  says they are always from replica 0 (since Header.Block.replica == 0 always). So, if they are
  being sent by a non-R0 replica, it drops the messages with "message from unexpected peer".

  This leads to a replica being stuck in state sync and unable to progress.

- [#2137](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2137)

  It was possible for a prepare to exist in a mixture of WALs and checkpoints, which could
  compromise physical durability under storage fault conditions, since the data is present across a
  commit-quorum of replicas in different forms.

  Rather, ensure a prepare in the WAL is only overwritten if it belongs to a commit-quorum of
  checkpoints.

- [#2127](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2127),
  [#2096](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2096)

  A few CI changes: run tests in CI for x86_64 macOS, add in client tests on macOS and run the
  benchmark with `--validate` in CI.

- [#2117](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2117)

  TigerBeetle reserves the most significant bit of the timestamp as the tombstone flag, so indicate
  and assert that timestamp_max is a `maxInt(u63)`.

- [#2123](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2123),
  [#2125](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2125)

  Internally, TigerBeetle uses AEGIS-128L for checksumming - hardware AES is a prerequisite for
  performance. Due to a build system bug, releases being built with a specified (`-Dtarget=`) target
  would only be built with baseline CPU features, and thus use the software AES implementation.

  Enforce at comptime that hardware acceleration is available, fix the build system bug, log
  checksum performance on our [devhub](https://tigerbeetle.github.io/tigerbeetle/) and build client
  libraries with hardware acceleration too.

- [#2139](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2139)

  TigerBeetle would wait until all repairable headers are fixed before trying to commits prepares,
  but if all the headers after the checkpoint are present then we can start committing even if
  some headers from before the checkpoint are missing.

- [#2141](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2141)

  Clarify that the order of replicas in `--addresses` is important. Currently, the order of replicas
  as specified has a direct impact on how messages are routed between them. Having a differing order
  leads to significantly degraded performance.

- [#2120](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2120)

  The state machine depended on `prepare_timestamp` to evaluate `pulse()`, but in an idle cluster,
  `prepare_timestamp` would only be set if pulse returned true! Thanks @ikolomiets for reporting.

- [#2028](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2028)

  Add a fuzzer for scans.

- [#2109](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2109)

  Fuzz `storage.zig`, by using a mocked IO layer.

### Features

- [#2070](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2070)

  Certain workloads (for example, sending in tiny batches) can cause high amounts of space
  amplification in TigerBeetle, leading to data file sizes that are much larger than optimal.

  This introduces a stopgap fix, greedily coalescing tables in level 0 of the LSM, which improves
  space amplification dramatically.

- [#2003](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2003)

  Add a data file inspector tool to the TigerBeetle CLI, handy for development and debugging alike.
  You can run it with `tigerbeetle inspect --help`.

- [#2136](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2136),
  [#2013](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2013),
  [#2126](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2126)

  TigerBeetle clusters can now be [upgraded](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/operating/upgrading)!

- [#2095](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2095)

  Add a custom formatter for displaying units in error messages. Thanks @tensorush!

### Internals

- [#1380](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1380)

  Allows for language clients to manage their own `Packet` memory, removing the need for tb_client
  to do so and thus removing the concepts of acquire/release_packet and concurrency_max.

- [#2148](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2148)

  Add function length limits to our internal tidy tests.

- [#2116](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2116),
  [#2114](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2114),
  [#2111](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2111),
  [#2132](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2132),
  [#2131](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2131),
  [#2124](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2124)

  Lots of small [CFO](https://tigerbeetle.github.io/tigerbeetle/) improvements.

- [#2090](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2090)

  Call `fs_sync` on macOS/Darwin after each write to properly deal with Darwin's `O_DSYNC` which
  [doesn't behave like `O_DSYNC` on Linux](https://x.com/TigerBeetleDB/status/1536628729031581697).

### Features

- [#2080](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2080)

  New operations `query accounts` and `query transfers` as a stopgap API to add some degree of
  user-defined query capabilities.
  This is an experimental feature meant to be replaced by a proper querying API.


### Internals

- [#2067](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2067)

  according to
  [TigerStyle](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md#style-by-the-numbers)!

- [#2081](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2081)

  Run `kcov` during CI as a code coverage sanity check. No automated action is taken regarding the
  results. We're not focused on tracking the quantitative coverage metric, but rather on surfacing
  blind spots qualitatively.

  Big improvements to allowing TigerBeetle to run with less memory! You can now run TigerBeetle
  in `--development` mode by default with an RSS of under 1GB. Most of these gains came from #1981
  which allows running with a smaller runtime request size.

- [#2014](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2014),
  [#2012](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/2012),

  [#1997](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1997)

  ⚡ Update Zig from 0.11.0 to 0.13.0! As part of this, replace non-mutated `var`s with `const`.

- [#1999](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1999)

  Similar to #1991, adds the async `io_uring_prep_statx` syscall for Linux's IO implementation,
  allowing non-blocking `statx()`s while serving requests - to determine when the binary on
  disk has changed.

### Safety And Performance

- [#1986](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1986)

  Refactor an internal iterator to expose a mutable pointer instead of calling `@constCast` on it.
  There was a comment justifying the operation's safety, but it turned out to be safer to expose
  it as a mutable pointer (avoiding misusage from the origin) rather than performing an unsound
  mutation over a constant pointer.

- [#1985](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1985)

  Implement a random Grid/Scrubber tour origin, where each replica starts scrubbing the local
  storage in a different place, covering more blocks across the entire cluster.

- [#1990](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1990)

  Model and calculate the probability of data loss in terms of the Grid/Scrubber cycle interval,
  allowing to reduce the read bandwidth dedicated for scrubbing.

- [#1987](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1987)

  Fix a simulator bug where all the WAL sectors get corrupted when a replica crashes while writing
  them simultaneously.

### Internals

- [#1991](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1991)

  As part of multiversioning binaries, adds the async `io_uring_prep_openat`syscall for Linux's IO
  implementation, allowing non-blocking `open()`s while serving requests (which will be necessary
  during upgrade checks).

- [#1982](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1982)

  Require the `--experimental` flag when starting TigerBeetle with flags that aren't considered
  stable, that is, flags not explicitly documented in the help message, limiting the surface area
  for future compatibility.

### Internals
- [#1925](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1925)

  Fix path handling on Windows by switching to `NtCreateFile`. Before, TigerBeetle would silently
  treat all paths as relative on Windows.

  Fixes and performance improvements to fuzzers.

- [#1897](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1897)

  Reduces cache size for the `--development` flag, which was originally created to bypass direct
  I/O requirements but can also aggregate other convenient options for non-production environments.

- [#1895](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1895)

  Reduction in memory footprint, calculating the maximum number of messages from runtime-known
  configurations.

### Features

- [#1896](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1896)

  Removes the `bootstrap.{sh,bat}` scripts, replacing them with a more transparent instruction for
  downloading the binary release or building from source.

- [#1890](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1890)

  Nicely handles "illegal instruction" crashes, printing a friendly message when the CPU running a
  binary release is too old and does not support some modern instructions such as AES-NI and AVX2.

### Internals

- [#1892](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1892)

### Safety And Performance

- [#1810](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1810)

  Incrementally recompute the number values to compact in the storage engine. This smooths out I/O
  latency, giving a nice bump to transaction throughput under load.

### Features

- [#1843](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1843)

  Add `--development` flag to `format` and `start` commands in production binaries to downgrade
  lack of Direct I/O support from a hard error to a warning.

  TigerBeetle uses Direct I/O for certain safety guarantees, but this feature is not available on
  all development environments due to varying file systems. This serves as a compromise between
  providing a separate development release binary and strictly requiring Direct I/O to be present.

### Internals

## 2024-03-19

- Bump version to 0.15.x
- Starting with 0.15.x, TigerBeetle is ready for production use, preserves durability and
  provides a forward upgrade path through storage stability.

### Safety And Performance
- [#1755](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1755)

  Set TigerBeetle's block size to 512KB.

  Previously, we used to have a block size of 1MB to help with approximate pacing. Now that pacing
  can be tuned independently of block size, reduce this value (but not too much - make the roads
  wider than you think) to help with read amplification on queries.

## 2024-03-18

### Safety And Performance

- [#1660](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1660)

  Implement compaction pacing: traditionally LSM databases run compaction on a background thread.
  In contrast compaction in tigerbeetle is deterministically interleaved with normal execution
  process, to get predictable latencies and to guarantee that ingress can never outrun compaction.

  In this PR, this "deterministic scheduling" is greatly improved, slicing compaction work into
  smaller bites which are more evenly distributed across a bar of batched requests.

- [#1722](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1722)

### Safety And Performance

- [#1533](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1533)

  DVCs implicitly nack missing prepares from old log-views.

  (This partially addresses a liveness issue in the view change.)

- [#1552](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1552)

  When a replica joins a view by receiving an SV message, some of the SV's headers may be too far
  ahead to insert into the journal. (That is, they are beyond the replica's checkpoint trigger.)

  During a view change, those headers are now eligible to be DVC headers.

- [#1446](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1446)

  Panic on checkpoint divergence. Previously, if a replica's state on disk diverged, we'd

### Safety And Performance

- [#1346](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1346)

  The simulator found a failure when the WAL gets corrupted near a checkpoint boundary, leading us
  to also consider scenarios where corrupted blocks in the grid end up "intersecting" with
  corruption in the WAL, making the state unrecoverable where it should be. We fixed it by
  extending the durability of "prepares", evicting them from the WAL only when there's a quorum of
  checkpoints covering this "prepare".

- [#1366](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1366)

  Fix a unit test that regressed after we changed an undesirable behavior that allowed `prefetch`
  to invoke its callback synchronously.

- [#1381](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1381)

  prepares, as long as they are from a past checkpoint.

### Features

- [#1054](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1054)

  A highly anticipated feature lands on TigerBeetle: it's now possible to retrieve the transfers

  Note that this feature itself is an ad-hoc API intended to be replaced once we have a proper
  Querying API. The real improvement of this PR is the implementation of range queries, enabling
  us to land exciting new features on the next releases.

- [#1368](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1368)

  inserts.

- [#1257](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1257)

  Clients automatically batch pending similar requests 🎉! If a tigerbeetle client submits a
  request, and one with the same operation is currently in-flight, they will be grouped and
  processed together where possible (currently, only for `CreateAccount` and `CreateTransfers`).
  This should [greatly improve the performance](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1257#issuecomment-1812648270)
  of workloads which submit a single operation at a time.

  Fix free set index. The free set is a bitset of free blocks in the grid. To speed up block
  allocation, the free set also maintains an index --- a coarser-grained bitset where a single bit
  corresponds to 1024 blocks. Maintaining consistency between a data structure and its index is

  Remove format-time limit on the size of the data file. Before, the maximum size of the data file
  affected the layout of the superblock, and there wasn't any good way to increase this limit, short
  of recreating the cluster from scratch. Now, this limit only applies to the in-memory data
  structures: when a data files grows large, it is sufficient to just restart its replica with a
  larger amount of RAM.

  Remove a trailing comma in our Java client sample code.

- [#1313](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1313)

  Switch `bootstrap.sh` to use spaces only for indentation and ensure it's checked by our
  shellcheck lint.

- [#1314](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1314)

### Safety And Performance

- [#1300](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1300)

  Recursively check for padding in structs used for data serialization, ensuring that no
  uninitialized bytes can be stored or transmitted over the network. Previously, we checked only
  if the struct had no padding, but not its fields.

### Internals

- [#1299](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1299)

  Minor adjustments in the release process, making it easier to track updates in the documentation
  website when a new version is released, even if there are no changes in the documentation itself.

- [#1301](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1301)

  Fix outdated documentation regarding 128-bit balances.

- [#1302](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1302)

  Fix a [bug](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/issues/1290) discovered and reported
  during the [Hackathon 2023](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/hackathon-2023), where the Node.js
  client's error messages were truncated due to an incorrect string concatenation adding a null
  byte `0x00` in the middle of the string.

- [#1291](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1291)

  Update the Node.js samples instructions, guiding the user to install all dependencies before
  the sample project.

- [#1295](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1295)

  We've doubled the `Header`s size to 256 bytes, paving the way for future improvements that will
  require extra space. Concurrently, this change also refactors a great deal of code.
  Some of the `Header`'s fields are shared by all messages, however, each `Command` also requires
  specific pieces of information that are only used by its kind of message, and it was necessary to
  repurpose and reinterpret fields so that the same header could hold different data depending on
  the context. Now, commands have their own specialized data type containing the fields that are
  only pertinent to the context, making the API much safer and intent-clear.

- [#1304](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1304)

  With larger headers (see #1295) we have enough room to make the cluster ID a 128-bit integer,
  allowing operators to generate random cluster IDs without the cost of having a centralized ID
  coordinator. Also updates the documentation and sample programs to reflect the new maximum batch
  size, which was reduced from 8191 to 8190 items after we doubled the header.

- [#1278](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1278)

  Fix a crash caused by a race between state (table) sync and a move-table compaction.

  Both bugs didn't stand a chance in the [Line of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq-G3EWO9XM)
  of our deterministic simulator!

### Internals

- [#1244](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1244)

  Specify which CPU features are supported in builds.

- [#1275](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1275)

  Improve `shell.zig`'s directory handling, to guard against mistakes with respect to the current
  working directory.

### Safety And Performance

- [#1263](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1263)

  Revive the TigerBeetle [VOPRHub](https://github.com/tigerbeetle-vopr)! Some previous changes left
  it on it's [Last Stand](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ibHApXtb0pgplmNDRLHrJ), but the bot is
  back in business finding liveness bugs:
  [#1266](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/issues/1266)

### Features

- [#1260](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1260)

  Set the latest Docker image to track the latest release. Avoids language clients going out of sync
  with your default docker replica installations.

### Internals

- [#1261](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1261)

  Move website doc generation for https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/ into the main repo.

- [#1265](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1265),
  [#1243](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1243)

  Addressed some release quirks with the .NET and Go client builds.

## 2023-10-30

### Safety And Performance

- [#1251](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1251)

  Prove a tighter upper bound for the size of manifest log. With this new bound, manifest log is
  guaranteed to fit in allocated memory and is smaller. Additionally, manifest log compaction is
  paced depending on the current length of the log, balancing throughput and time-to-recovery.

- [#1198](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1198)

  Recommend using [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec) for event IDs. ULIDs are approximately
  sorted, which significantly improves common-case performance.

### Internals

- [#1218](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1218)

  Rewrite Node.js client implementation to use the common C client underneath. While clients for
  other languages already use the underlying C library, the Node.js client duplicated some code for
  historical reasons, but now we can leave that duplication in the past. [This Is A
  Photograph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0i7whWLW8M).

## 2023-10-25

### Safety And Performance

- [#1240](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1240)

  Increase block size to reduce latencies due to compaction work. Today, we use a simplistic
  schedule for compaction, which causes latency spikes at the end of the bar. While the future
  solution will implement a smarter compaction pacing to distribute the work more evenly, we can
  get a quick win by tweaking the block and the bar size, which naturally evens out latency spikes.

- [#1246](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1246)

  The new release process changed the names of the published artifacts (the version is no longer
  included in the name). This broke our quick start scripts, which we have fixed. Note that we are
  in the process of rolling out the new release process, so some unexpected breakage is expected.

- [#1239](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1239),
  [#1243](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1243)

  Speed up secondary index maintenance by statically distinguishing between insertions and
  updates. [Faster than the speed of night!](https://open.spotify.com/track/30oZqbcUROFLSru3WcN3bx)

### Features

- [#1245](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1245)

  Include Docker images in the release.

### Internals

- [#1234](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1234)

  Simplify superblock layout by using a linked list of blocks for manifest log, so that the
  superblock needs to store only two block references.

  P.S. Note the PR number!

## 2023-10-23

This is the start of the changelog. A lot happened before this point and is lost in the mist of git
history, but any notable change from this point on shall be captured by this document.

### Safety And Performance

- [#1225](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1225)

  Remove bloom filters. TigerBeetle implements more targeted optimizations for
  both positive and negative lookups, making bloom filters a net loss.

### Features

- [#1228](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1228)

  Increase alignment of data blocks to 128KiB (from 512 bytes). Larger alignment gives operators
  better control over physical layout of data on disk.

### Internals

- [#1201](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1201),
  [#1232](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1232)

  Overhaul of CI and release infrastructure. CI and releases are now driven by Zig code. The main
  branch is gated on integration tests for all clients.

  This is done in preparation for the first TigerBeetle release.
